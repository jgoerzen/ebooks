<h1>WUTHERING HEIGHTS</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>1801.&mdash;I have just returned from a visit to my 
landlord&mdash;the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled 
with.&nbsp; This is certainly a beautiful country!&nbsp; In all 
England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation 
so completely removed from the stir of society.&nbsp; A perfect 
misanthropist&rsquo;s heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a
suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.&nbsp; A 
capital fellow!&nbsp; He little imagined how my heart warmed 
towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously
under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered 
themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his 
waistcoat, as I announced my name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Heathcliff?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>A nod was the answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir.&nbsp; I do myself 
the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival, to 
express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my 
perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange: 
I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,&rsquo; he 
interrupted, wincing.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should not allow any one to 
inconvenience me, if I could hinder it&mdash;walk in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;walk in&rsquo; was uttered with closed teeth, and 
expressed the sentiment, &lsquo;Go to the Deuce:&rsquo; even the 
gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to 
the words; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept 
the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed more 
exaggeratedly reserved than myself.</p>
<p>When he saw my horse&rsquo;s breast fairly pushing the 
barrier, he did put out his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly
preceded me up the causeway, calling, as we entered the 
court,&mdash;&lsquo;Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood&rsquo;s horse; and 
bring up some wine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I 
suppose,&rsquo; was the reflection suggested by this compound 
order.&nbsp; &lsquo;No wonder the grass grows up between the 
flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, 
though hale and sinewy.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Lord help us!&rsquo; he 
soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure, while 
relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime, in my face so sourly
that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to 
digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no reference to 
my unexpected advent.</p>
<p>Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff&rsquo;s 
dwelling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wuthering&rsquo; being a significant 
provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to 
which its station is exposed in stormy weather.&nbsp; Pure, 
bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed:
one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, 
by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the 
house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs 
one way, as if craving alms of the sun.&nbsp; Happily, the 
architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows 
are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large 
jutting stones.</p>
<p>Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of
grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about 
the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling 
griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date 
&lsquo;1500,&rsquo; and the name &lsquo;Hareton 
Earnshaw.&rsquo;&nbsp; I would have made a few comments, and 
requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but 
his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, 
or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his 
impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.</p>
<p>One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any 
introductory lobby or passage: they call it here &lsquo;the 
house&rsquo; pre-eminently.&nbsp; It includes kitchen and 
parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the 
kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at 
least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of 
culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of 
roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any 
glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the 
walls.&nbsp; One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and
heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with 
silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak 
dresser, to the very roof.&nbsp; The latter had never been 
under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, 
except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of 
legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.&nbsp; Above the 
chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of 
horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted 
canisters disposed along its ledge.&nbsp; The floor was of 
smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive 
structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in
the shade.&nbsp; In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, 
liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing 
puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.</p>
<p>The apartment and furniture would have been nothing 
extraordinary as belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a 
stubborn countenance, and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in 
knee-breeches and gaiters.&nbsp; Such an individual seated in his
arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him,
is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these 
hills, if you go at the right time after dinner.&nbsp; But Mr. 
Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of 
living.&nbsp; He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and 
manners a gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a 
country squire: rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss 
with his negligence, because he has an erect and handsome figure;
and rather morose.&nbsp; Possibly, some people might suspect him 
of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic chord 
within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by 
instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays 
of feeling&mdash;to manifestations of mutual kindliness.&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;ll love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a 
species of impertinence to be loved or hated again.&nbsp; No, 
I&rsquo;m running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes 
over-liberally on him.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely 
dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he 
meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me.&nbsp; 
Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother 
used to say I should never have a comfortable home; and only last
summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.</p>
<p>While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was
thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real 
goddess in my eyes, as long as she took no notice of me.&nbsp; I 
&lsquo;never told my love&rsquo; vocally; still, if looks have 
language, the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and
ears: she understood me at last, and looked a return&mdash;the 
sweetest of all imaginable looks.&nbsp; And what did I do?&nbsp; 
I confess it with shame&mdash;shrunk icily into myself, like a 
snail; at every glance retired colder and farther; till finally 
the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses, and, 
overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake, persuaded her
mamma to decamp.&nbsp; By this curious turn of disposition I have
gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how 
undeserved, I alone can appreciate.</p>
<p>I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that 
towards which my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of 
silence by attempting to caress the canine mother, who had left 
her nursery, and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, 
her lip curled up, and her white teeth watering for a 
snatch.&nbsp; My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better let the dog alone,&rsquo; growled 
Mr. Heathcliff in unison, checking fiercer demonstrations with a 
punch of his foot.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s not accustomed to be 
spoiled&mdash;not kept for a pet.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, striding to 
a side door, he shouted again, &lsquo;Joseph!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but 
gave no intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him,
leaving me <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the ruffianly bitch and a pair
of grim shaggy sheep-dogs, who shared with her a jealous 
guardianship over all my movements.&nbsp; Not anxious to come in 
contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining they would 
scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged in 
winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my 
physiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a 
fury and leapt on my knees.&nbsp; I flung her back, and hastened 
to interpose the table between us.&nbsp; This proceeding aroused 
the whole hive: half-a-dozen four-footed fiends, of various sizes
and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre.&nbsp; I 
felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and 
parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with
the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from 
some of the household in re-establishing peace.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with 
vexatious phlegm: I don&rsquo;t think they moved one second 
faster than usual, though the hearth was an absolute tempest of 
worrying and yelping.&nbsp; Happily, an inhabitant of the kitchen
made more despatch: a lusty dame, with tucked-up gown, bare arms,
and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the midst of us flourishing 
a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her tongue, to such 
purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she only 
remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master 
entered on the scene.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the devil is the matter?&rsquo; he asked, eyeing 
me in a manner that I could ill endure, after this inhospitable 
treatment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the devil, indeed!&rsquo; I muttered.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse 
spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir.&nbsp; You might
as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They won&rsquo;t meddle with persons who touch 
nothing,&rsquo; he remarked, putting the bottle before me, and 
restoring the displaced table.&nbsp; &lsquo;The dogs do right to 
be vigilant.&nbsp; Take a glass of wine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not bitten, are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I had been, I would have set my signet on the 
biter.&rsquo;&nbsp; Heathcliff&rsquo;s countenance relaxed into a
grin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you are flurried, 
Mr. Lockwood.&nbsp; Here, take a little wine.&nbsp; Guests are so
exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs, I am willing 
to own, hardly know how to receive them.&nbsp; Your health, 
sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it
would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of
curs; besides, I felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement 
at my expense; since his humour took that turn.&nbsp; 
He&mdash;probably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly
of offending a good tenant&mdash;relaxed a little in the laconic 
style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs, and 
introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to 
me,&mdash;a discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my 
present place of retirement.&nbsp; I found him very intelligent 
on the topics we touched; and before I went home, I was 
encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow.&nbsp; 
He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.&nbsp; I shall 
go, notwithstanding.&nbsp; It is astonishing how sociable I feel 
myself compared with him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold.&nbsp; I had half a 
mind to spend it by my study fire, instead of wading through 
heath and mud to Wuthering Heights.&nbsp; On coming up from 
dinner, however, (N.B.&mdash;I dine between twelve and one 
o&rsquo;clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a 
fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend
my request that I might be served at five)&mdash;on mounting the 
stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I 
saw a servant-girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and 
coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished 
the flames with heaps of cinders.&nbsp; This spectacle drove me 
back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles&rsquo; 
walk, arrived at Heathcliff&rsquo;s garden-gate just in time to 
escape the first feathery flakes of a snow-shower.</p>
<p>On that bleak hill-top the earth was hard with a black frost, 
and the air made me shiver through every limb.&nbsp; Being unable
to remove the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged 
causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked 
vainly for admittance, till my knuckles tingled and the dogs 
howled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wretched inmates!&rsquo; I ejaculated, mentally, 
&lsquo;you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your
churlish inhospitality.&nbsp; At least, I would not keep my doors
barred in the day-time.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I will get
in!&rsquo;&nbsp; So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it 
vehemently.&nbsp; Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a 
round window of the barn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are ye for?&rsquo; he shouted.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;T&rsquo; maister&rsquo;s down i&rsquo; t&rsquo; 
fowld.&nbsp; Go round by th&rsquo; end o&rsquo; t&rsquo; laith, 
if ye went to spake to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there nobody inside to open the door?&rsquo; I 
hallooed, responsively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nobbut t&rsquo; missis; and shoo&rsquo;ll
not oppen &rsquo;t an ye mak&rsquo; yer flaysome dins till 
neeght.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&nbsp; Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, 
Joseph?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor-ne me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hae no hend 
wi&rsquo;t,&rsquo; muttered the head, vanishing.</p>
<p>The snow began to drive thickly.&nbsp; I seized the handle to 
essay another trial; when a young man without coat, and 
shouldering a pitchfork, appeared in the yard behind.&nbsp; He 
hailed me to follow him, and, after marching through a 
wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed, pump, and 
pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful 
apartment where I was formerly received.&nbsp; It glowed 
delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire, compounded of 
coal, peat, and wood; and near the table, laid for a plentiful 
evening meal, I was pleased to observe the &lsquo;missis,&rsquo; 
an individual whose existence I had never previously 
suspected.&nbsp; I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me 
take a seat.&nbsp; She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, 
and remained motionless and mute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rough weather!&rsquo; I remarked.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door must bear the 
consequence of your servants&rsquo; leisure attendance: I had 
hard work to make them hear me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She never opened her mouth.&nbsp; I stared&mdash;she stared 
also: at any rate, she kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless 
manner, exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; said the young man, gruffly.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be in soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who 
deigned, at this second interview, to move the extreme tip of her
tail, in token of owning my acquaintance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A beautiful animal!&rsquo; I commenced again.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Do you intend parting with the little ones, 
madam?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are not mine,&rsquo; said the amiable hostess, 
more repellingly than Heathcliff himself could have replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, your favourites are among these?&rsquo; I 
continued, turning to an obscure cushion full of something like 
cats.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A strange choice of favourites!&rsquo; she observed 
scornfully.</p>
<p>Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits.&nbsp; I hemmed once 
more, and drew closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the 
wildness of the evening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not have come out,&rsquo; she said, rising 
and reaching from the chimney-piece two of the painted 
canisters.</p>
<p>Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a
distinct view of her whole figure and countenance.&nbsp; She was 
slender, and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable 
form, and the most exquisite little face that I have ever had the
pleasure of beholding; small features, very fair; flaxen 
ringlets, or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate neck; 
and eyes, had they been agreeable in expression, that would have 
been irresistible: fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only
sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of 
desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there.&nbsp; The
canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid 
her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one 
attempted to assist him in counting his gold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want your help,&rsquo; she snapped; 
&lsquo;I can get them for myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon!&rsquo; I hastened to reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you asked to tea?&rsquo; she demanded, tying an 
apron over her neat black frock, and standing with a spoonful of 
the leaf poised over the pot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be glad to have a cup,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you asked?&rsquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, half smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are 
the proper person to ask me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair 
in a pet; her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed 
out, like a child&rsquo;s ready to cry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a 
decidedly shabby upper garment, and, erecting himself before the 
blaze, looked down on me from the corner of his eyes, for all the
world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between 
us.&nbsp; I began to doubt whether he were a servant or not: his 
dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of the 
superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick 
brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached 
bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like 
those of a common labourer: still his bearing was free, almost 
haughty, and he showed none of a domestic&rsquo;s assiduity in 
attending on the lady of the house.&nbsp; In the absence of clear
proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain from 
noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the 
entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my 
uncomfortable state.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!&rsquo; I
exclaimed, assuming the cheerful; &lsquo;and I fear I shall be 
weather-bound for half an hour, if you can afford me shelter 
during that space.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Half an hour?&rsquo; he said, shaking the white flakes 
from his clothes; &lsquo;I wonder you should select the thick of 
a snow-storm to ramble about in.&nbsp; Do you know that you run a
risk of being lost in the marshes?&nbsp; People familiar with 
these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I can 
tell you there is no chance of a change at present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might
stay at the Grange till morning&mdash;could you spare me 
one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I could not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed!&nbsp; Well, then, I must trust to my own 
sagacity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Umph!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you going to mak&rsquo; the tea?&rsquo; demanded he
of the shabby coat, shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the 
young lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is <i>he</i> to have any?&rsquo; she asked, appealing 
to Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get it ready, will you?&rsquo; was the answer, uttered 
so savagely that I started.&nbsp; The tone in which the words 
were said revealed a genuine bad nature.&nbsp; I no longer felt 
inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.&nbsp; When the 
preparations were finished, he invited me with&mdash;&lsquo;Now, 
sir, bring forward your chair.&rsquo;&nbsp; And we all, including
the rustic youth, drew round the table: an austere silence 
prevailing while we discussed our meal.</p>
<p>I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make 
an effort to dispel it.&nbsp; They could not every day sit so 
grim and taciturn; and it was impossible, however ill-tempered 
they might be, that the universal scowl they wore was their 
every-day countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is strange,&rsquo; I began, in the interval of 
swallowing one cup of tea and receiving another&mdash;&lsquo;it 
is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas: many could 
not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete
exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet, 
I&rsquo;ll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and 
with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and
heart&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My amiable lady!&rsquo; he interrupted, with an almost 
diabolical sneer on his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is she&mdash;my 
amiable lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes&mdash;oh, you would intimate that her spirit 
has taken the post of ministering angel, and guards the fortunes 
of Wuthering Heights, even when her body is gone.&nbsp; Is that 
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct 
it.&nbsp; I might have seen there was too great a disparity 
between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were 
man and wife.&nbsp; One was about forty: a period of mental 
vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married 
for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace of our 
declining years.&nbsp; The other did not look seventeen.</p>
<p>Then it flashed on me&mdash;&lsquo;The clown at my elbow, who 
is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his broad with 
unwashed hands, may be her husband: Heathcliff junior, of 
course.&nbsp; Here is the consequence of being buried alive: she 
has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that 
better individuals existed!&nbsp; A sad pity&mdash;I must beware 
how I cause her to regret her choice.&rsquo;&nbsp; The last 
reflection may seem conceited; it was not.&nbsp; My neighbour 
struck me as bordering on repulsive; I knew, through experience, 
that I was tolerably attractive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,&rsquo; said 
Heathcliff, corroborating my surmise.&nbsp; He turned, as he 
spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a look of hatred; unless
he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not, like 
those of other people, interpret the language of his soul.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, certainly&mdash;I see now: you are the favoured 
possessor of the beneficent fairy,&rsquo; I remarked, turning to 
my neighbour.</p>
<p>This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and 
clenched his fist, with every appearance of a meditated 
assault.&nbsp; But he seemed to recollect himself presently, and 
smothered the storm in a brutal curse, muttered on my behalf: 
which, however, I took care not to notice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,&rsquo; observed my 
host; &lsquo;we neither of us have the privilege of owning your 
good fairy; her mate is dead.&nbsp; I said she was my 
daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my 
son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And this young man is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not my son, assuredly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest 
to attribute the paternity of that bear to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name is Hareton Earnshaw,&rsquo; growled the other; 
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;d counsel you to respect it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve shown no disrespect,&rsquo; was my reply, 
laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced 
himself.</p>
<p>He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the 
stare, for fear I might be tempted either to box his ears or 
render my hilarity audible.&nbsp; I began to feel unmistakably 
out of place in that pleasant family circle.&nbsp; The dismal 
spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralised, the 
glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to be cautious
how I ventured under those rafters a third time.</p>
<p>The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a 
word of sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine 
the weather.&nbsp; A sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming 
down prematurely, and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl 
of wind and suffocating snow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it possible for me to get home now 
without a guide,&rsquo; I could not help exclaiming.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;The roads will be buried already; and, if they were bare, 
I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn 
porch.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be covered if left in the fold all 
night: and put a plank before them,&rsquo; said Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How must I do?&rsquo; I continued, with rising 
irritation.</p>
<p>There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw 
only Joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs.
Heathcliff leaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning 
a bundle of matches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as 
she restored the tea-canister to its place.&nbsp; The former, 
when he had deposited his burden, took a critical survey of the 
room, and in cracked tones grated out&mdash;&lsquo;Aw wonder how 
yah can faishion to stand thear i&rsquo; idleness un war, when 
all on &rsquo;ems goan out!&nbsp; Bud yah&rsquo;re a nowt, and 
it&rsquo;s no use talking&mdash;yah&rsquo;ll niver mend 
o&rsquo;yer ill ways, but goa raight to t&rsquo; divil, like yer 
mother afore ye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was 
addressed to me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the 
aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the 
door.&nbsp; Mrs. Heathcliff, however, checked me by her 
answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You scandalous old hypocrite!&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Are you not afraid of being carried away bodily, whenever 
you mention the devil&rsquo;s name?&nbsp; I warn you to refrain 
from provoking me, or I&rsquo;ll ask your abduction as a special 
favour!&nbsp; Stop! look here, Joseph,&rsquo; she continued, 
taking a long, dark book from a shelf; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you
how far I&rsquo;ve progressed in the Black Art: I shall soon be 
competent to make a clear house of it.&nbsp; The red cow 
didn&rsquo;t die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be 
reckoned among providential visitations!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, wicked, wicked!&rsquo; gasped the elder; &lsquo;may
the Lord deliver us from evil!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, reprobate! you are a castaway&mdash;be off, or 
I&rsquo;ll hurt you seriously!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have you all 
modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes the limits I 
fix shall&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not say what he shall be done 
to&mdash;but, you&rsquo;ll see!&nbsp; Go, I&rsquo;m looking at 
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes,
and Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, 
and ejaculating &lsquo;wicked&rsquo; as he went.&nbsp; I thought 
her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun; and, now
that we were alone, I endeavoured to interest her in my 
distress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Heathcliff,&rsquo; I said earnestly, &lsquo;you 
must excuse me for troubling you.&nbsp; I presume, because, with 
that face, I&rsquo;m sure you cannot help being 
good-hearted.&nbsp; Do point out some landmarks by which I may 
know my way home: I have no more idea how to get there than you 
would have how to get to London!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take the road you came,&rsquo; she answered, ensconcing
herself in a chair, with a candle, and the long book open before 
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is brief advice, but as sound as I can 
give.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog 
or a pit full of snow, your conscience won&rsquo;t whisper that 
it is partly your fault?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How so?&nbsp; I cannot escort you.&nbsp; They 
wouldn&rsquo;t let me go to the end of the garden 
wall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>You</i>!&nbsp; I should be sorry to ask you to cross
the threshold, for my convenience, on such a night,&rsquo; I 
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want you to tell me my way, not to 
<i>show</i> it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a 
guide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&nbsp; There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph 
and I.&nbsp; Which would you have?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are there no boys at the farm?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; those are all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, it follows that I am compelled to 
stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you may settle with your host.&nbsp; I have 
nothing to do with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash 
journeys on these hills,&rsquo; cried Heathcliff&rsquo;s stern 
voice from the kitchen entrance.&nbsp; &lsquo;As to staying here,
I don&rsquo;t keep accommodations for visitors: you must share a 
bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can sleep on a chair in this room,&rsquo; I 
replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&nbsp; A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or 
poor: it will not suit me to permit any one the range of the 
place while I am off guard!&rsquo; said the unmannerly 
wretch.</p>
<p>With this insult my patience was at an end.&nbsp; I uttered an
expression of disgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running
against Earnshaw in my haste.&nbsp; It was so dark that I could 
not see the means of exit; and, as I wandered round, I heard 
another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each 
other.&nbsp; At first the young man appeared about to befriend 
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go with him as far as the park,&rsquo; he 
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll go with him to hell!&rsquo; exclaimed his 
master, or whatever relation he bore.&nbsp; &lsquo;And who is to 
look after the horses, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man&rsquo;s life is of more consequence than one 
evening&rsquo;s neglect of the horses: somebody must go,&rsquo; 
murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I expected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at your command!&rsquo; retorted Hareton.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;If you set store on him, you&rsquo;d better be 
quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. 
Heathcliff will never get another tenant till the Grange is a 
ruin,&rsquo; she answered, sharply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hearken, hearken, shoo&rsquo;s cursing on 
&rsquo;em!&rsquo; muttered Joseph, towards whom I had been 
steering.</p>
<p>He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a 
lantern, which I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I 
would send it back on the morrow, rushed to the nearest 
postern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maister, maister, he&rsquo;s staling t&rsquo; 
lanthern!&rsquo; shouted the ancient, pursuing my retreat.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Hey, Gnasher!&nbsp; Hey, dog!&nbsp; Hey Wolf, holld him, 
holld him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my 
throat, bearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a 
mingled guffaw from Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on 
my rage and humiliation.&nbsp; Fortunately, the beasts seemed 
more bent on stretching their paws, and yawning, and flourishing 
their tails, than devouring me alive; but they would suffer no 
resurrection, and I was forced to lie till their malignant 
masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and trembling with 
wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out&mdash;on their 
peril to keep me one minute longer&mdash;with several incoherent 
threats of retaliation that, in their indefinite depth of 
virulency, smacked of King Lear.</p>
<p>The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at
the nose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I 
scolded.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what would have concluded the 
scene, had there not been one person at hand rather more rational
than myself, and more benevolent than my entertainer.&nbsp; This 
was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued forth to 
inquire into the nature of the uproar.&nbsp; She thought that 
some of them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring
to attack her master, she turned her vocal artillery against the 
younger scoundrel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mr. Earnshaw,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I wonder 
what you&rsquo;ll have agait next?&nbsp; Are we going to murder 
folk on our very door-stones?&nbsp; I see this house will never 
do for me&mdash;look at t&rsquo; poor lad, he&rsquo;s fair 
choking!&nbsp; Wisht, wisht; you mun&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go on 
so.&nbsp; Come in, and I&rsquo;ll cure that: there now, hold ye 
still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water 
down my neck, and pulled me into the kitchen.&nbsp; Mr. 
Heathcliff followed, his accidental merriment expiring quickly in
his habitual moroseness.</p>
<p>I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus 
compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof.&nbsp; He 
told Zillah to give me a glass of brandy, and then passed on to 
the inner room; while she condoled with me on my sorry 
predicament, and having obeyed his orders, whereby I was somewhat
revived, ushered me to bed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>While leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should 
hide the candle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd 
notion about the chamber she would put me in, and never let 
anybody lodge there willingly.&nbsp; I asked the reason.&nbsp; 
She did not know, she answered: she had only lived there a year 
or two; and they had so many queer goings on, she could not begin
to be curious.</p>
<p>Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and 
glanced round for the bed.&nbsp; The whole furniture consisted of
a chair, a clothes-press, and a large oak case, with squares cut 
out near the top resembling coach windows.&nbsp; Having 
approached this structure, I looked inside, and perceived it to 
be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch, very conveniently 
designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family 
having a room to himself.&nbsp; In fact, it formed a little 
closet, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a
table.&nbsp; I slid back the panelled sides, got in with my 
light, pulled them together again, and felt secure against the 
vigilance of Heathcliff, and every one else.</p>
<p>The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books 
piled up in one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched
on the paint.&nbsp; This writing, however, was nothing but a name
repeated in all kinds of characters, large and 
small&mdash;<i>Catherine Earnshaw</i>, here and there varied to 
<i>Catherine Heathcliff</i>, and then again to <i>Catherine 
Linton</i>.</p>
<p>In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and 
continued spelling over Catherine 
Earnshaw&mdash;Heathcliff&mdash;Linton, till my eyes closed; but 
they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters 
started from the dark, as vivid as spectres&mdash;the air swarmed
with Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name,
I discovered my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique 
volumes, and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted 
calf-skin.&nbsp; I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under 
the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat up and spread 
open the injured tome on my knee.&nbsp; It was a Testament, in 
lean type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the 
inscription&mdash;&lsquo;Catherine Earnshaw, her book,&rsquo; and
a date some quarter of a century back.&nbsp; I shut it, and took 
up another and another, till I had examined all.&nbsp; 
Catherine&rsquo;s library was select, and its state of 
dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not 
altogether for a legitimate purpose: scarcely one chapter had 
escaped, a pen-and-ink commentary&mdash;at least the appearance 
of one&mdash;covering every morsel of blank that the printer had 
left.&nbsp; Some were detached sentences; other parts took the 
form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish 
hand.&nbsp; At the top of an extra page (quite a treasure, 
probably, when first lighted on) I was greatly amused to behold 
an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph,&mdash;rudely, yet 
powerfully sketched.&nbsp; An immediate interest kindled within 
me for the unknown Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher 
her faded hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An awful Sunday,&rsquo; commenced the paragraph 
beneath.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish my father were back again.&nbsp; 
Hindley is a detestable substitute&mdash;his conduct to 
Heathcliff is atrocious&mdash;H. and I are going to 
rebel&mdash;we took our initiatory step this evening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to
church, so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret;
and, while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a 
comfortable fire&mdash;doing anything but reading their Bibles, 
I&rsquo;ll answer for it&mdash;Heathcliff, myself, and the 
unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer-books, and 
mount: we were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn, groaning and 
shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so that he 
might give us a short homily for his own sake.&nbsp; A vain 
idea!&nbsp; The service lasted precisely three hours; and yet my 
brother had the face to exclaim, when he saw us descending, 
&ldquo;What, done already?&rdquo;&nbsp; On Sunday evenings we 
used to be permitted to play, if we did not make much noise; now 
a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You forget you have a master here,&rdquo; says 
the tyrant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll demolish the first who puts 
me out of temper!&nbsp; I insist on perfect sobriety and 
silence.&nbsp; Oh, boy! was that you?&nbsp; Frances darling, pull
his hair as you go by: I heard him snap his fingers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Frances pulled his hair heartily, and then went and seated 
herself on her husband&rsquo;s knee, and there they were, like 
two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the 
hour&mdash;foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of.&nbsp; We
made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the 
dresser.&nbsp; I had just fastened our pinafores together, and 
hung them up for a curtain, when in comes Joseph, on an errand 
from the stables.&nbsp; He tears down my handiwork, boxes my 
ears, and croaks:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;T&rsquo; maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath
not o&rsquo;ered, und t&rsquo; sound o&rsquo; t&rsquo; gospel 
still i&rsquo; yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking!&nbsp; Shame on 
ye! sit ye down, ill childer! there&rsquo;s good books eneugh if 
ye&rsquo;ll read &rsquo;em: sit ye down, and think o&rsquo; yer 
sowls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions
that we might receive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us
the text of the lumber he thrust upon us.&nbsp; I could not bear 
the employment.&nbsp; I took my dingy volume by the scroop, and 
hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I hated a good book.&nbsp; 
Heathcliff kicked his to the same place.&nbsp; Then there was a 
hubbub!</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Maister Hindley!&rdquo; shouted our 
chaplain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maister, coom hither!&nbsp; Miss 
Cathy&rsquo;s riven th&rsquo; back off &lsquo;Th&rsquo; Helmet 
o&rsquo; Salvation,&rsquo; un&rsquo; Heathcliff&rsquo;s pawsed 
his fit into t&rsquo; first part o&rsquo; &lsquo;T&rsquo; Brooad 
Way to Destruction!&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fair flaysome that ye
let &rsquo;em go on this gait.&nbsp; Ech! th&rsquo; owd man wad 
ha&rsquo; laced &rsquo;em properly&mdash;but he&rsquo;s 
goan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and
seizing one of us by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled
both into the back-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated, &ldquo;owd
Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living: and, so comforted,
we each sought a separate nook to await his advent.&nbsp; I 
reached this book, and a pot of ink from a shelf, and pushed the 
house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got the time on with
writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is impatient, and 
proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman&rsquo;s cloak,
and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter.&nbsp; A 
pleasant suggestion&mdash;and then, if the surly old man come in,
he may believe his prophecy verified&mdash;we cannot be damper, 
or colder, in the rain than we are here.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next 
sentence took up another subject: she waxed lachrymose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me 
cry so!&rsquo; she wrote.&nbsp; &lsquo;My head aches, till I 
cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I can&rsquo;t give 
over.&nbsp; Poor Heathcliff!&nbsp; Hindley calls him a vagabond, 
and won&rsquo;t let him sit with us, nor eat with us any more; 
and, he says, he and I must not play together, and threatens to 
turn him out of the house if we break his orders.&nbsp; He has 
been blaming our father (how dared he?) for treating H. too 
liberally; and swears he will reduce him to his right 
place&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>I began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered 
from manuscript to print.&nbsp; I saw a red ornamented 
title&mdash;&lsquo;Seventy Times Seven, and the First of the 
Seventy-First.&rsquo;&nbsp; A Pious Discourse delivered by the 
Reverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden 
Sough.&rsquo;&nbsp; And while I was, half-consciously, worrying 
my brain to guess what Jabez Branderham would make of his 
subject, I sank back in bed, and fell asleep.&nbsp; Alas, for the
effects of bad tea and bad temper!&nbsp; What else could it be 
that made me pass such a terrible night?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t 
remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was 
capable of suffering.</p>
<p>I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my 
locality.&nbsp; I thought it was morning; and I had set out on my
way home, with Joseph for a guide.&nbsp; The snow lay yards deep 
in our road; and, as we floundered on, my companion wearied me 
with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrim&rsquo;s
staff: telling me that I could never get into the house without 
one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel, which I 
understood to be so denominated.&nbsp; For a moment I considered 
it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance 
into my own residence.&nbsp; Then a new idea flashed across 
me.&nbsp; I was not going there: we were journeying to hear the 
famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the 
text&mdash;&lsquo;Seventy Times Seven;&rsquo; and either Joseph, 
the preacher, or I had committed the &lsquo;First of the 
Seventy-First,&rsquo; and were to be publicly exposed and 
excommunicated.</p>
<p>We came to the chapel.&nbsp; I have passed it really in my 
walks, twice or thrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: 
an elevated hollow, near a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to
answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited
there.&nbsp; The roof has been kept whole hitherto; but as the 
clergyman&rsquo;s stipend is only twenty pounds per annum, and a 
house with two rooms, threatening speedily to determine into one,
no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor: especially as 
it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him 
starve than increase the living by one penny from their own 
pockets.&nbsp; However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and 
attentive congregation; and he preached&mdash;good God! what a 
sermon; divided into <i>four hundred and ninety</i> parts, each 
fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit, and each 
discussing a separate sin!&nbsp; Where he searched for them, I 
cannot tell.&nbsp; He had his private manner of interpreting the 
phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different 
sins on every occasion.&nbsp; They were of the most curious 
character: odd transgressions that I never imagined 
previously.</p>
<p>Oh, how weary I grow.&nbsp; How I writhed, and yawned, and 
nodded, and revived!&nbsp; How I pinched and pricked myself, and 
rubbed my eyes, and stood up, and sat down again, and nudged 
Joseph to inform me if he would <i>ever</i> have done.&nbsp; I 
was condemned to hear all out: finally, he reached the 
&lsquo;<i>First of the Seventy-First</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; At that 
crisis, a sudden inspiration descended on me; I was moved to rise
and denounce Jabez Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no 
Christian need pardon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;sitting here within 
these four walls, at one stretch, I have endured and forgiven the
four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse.&nbsp; Seventy 
times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to 
depart&mdash;Seventy times seven times have you preposterously 
forced me to resume my seat.&nbsp; The four hundred and 
ninety-first is too much.&nbsp; Fellow-martyrs, have at 
him!&nbsp; Drag him down, and crush him to atoms, that the place 
which knows him may know him no more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Thou art the Man</i>!&rsquo; cried Jabez, after a 
solemn pause, leaning over his cushion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Seventy 
times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy 
visage&mdash;seventy times seven did I take counsel with my 
soul&mdash;Lo, this is human weakness: this also may be 
absolved!&nbsp; The First of the Seventy-First is come.&nbsp; 
Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written.&nbsp; Such 
honour have all His saints!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their 
pilgrim&rsquo;s staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having 
no weapon to raise in self-defence, commenced grappling with 
Joseph, my nearest and most ferocious assailant, for his.&nbsp; 
In the confluence of the multitude, several clubs crossed; blows,
aimed at me, fell on other sconces.&nbsp; Presently the whole 
chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings: every 
man&rsquo;s hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, 
unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of 
loud taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly
that, at last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me.&nbsp; And 
what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult?&nbsp; What 
had played Jabez&rsquo;s part in the row?&nbsp; Merely the branch
of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by, and
rattled its dry cones against the panes!&nbsp; I listened 
doubtingly an instant; detected the disturber, then turned and 
dozed, and dreamt again: if possible, still more disagreeably 
than before.</p>
<p>This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I 
heard distinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I 
heard, also, the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed
it to the right cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved
to silence it, if possible; and, I thought, I rose and 
endeavoured to unhasp the casement.&nbsp; The hook was soldered 
into the staple: a circumstance observed by me when awake, but 
forgotten.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must stop it, nevertheless!&rsquo; I 
muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching 
an arm out to seize the importunate branch; instead of which, my 
fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!&nbsp; 
The intense horror of nightmare came over me: I tried to draw 
back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a most melancholy 
voice sobbed, &lsquo;Let me in&mdash;let me in!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to 
disengage myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Catherine Linton,&rsquo; it 
replied, shiveringly (why did I think of <i>Linton</i>?&nbsp; I 
had read <i>Earnshaw</i> twenty times for 
Linton)&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m come home: I&rsquo;d lost my way 
on the moor!&rsquo;&nbsp; As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a 
child&rsquo;s face looking through the window.&nbsp; Terror made 
me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature
off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and rubbed it to 
and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes: still 
it wailed, &lsquo;Let me in!&rsquo; and maintained its tenacious 
gripe, almost maddening me with fear.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can 
I!&rsquo; I said at length.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let <i>me</i> go, if you
want me to let you in!&rsquo;&nbsp; The fingers relaxed, I 
snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a
pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable
prayer.&nbsp; I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an 
hour; yet, the instant I listened again, there was the doleful 
cry moaning on!&nbsp; &lsquo;Begone!&rsquo; I shouted.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty 
years.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is twenty years,&rsquo; mourned the
voice: &lsquo;twenty years.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a waif for 
twenty years!&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereat began a feeble scratching 
outside, and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward.&nbsp; 
I tried to jump up; but could not stir a limb; and so yelled 
aloud, in a frenzy of fright.&nbsp; To my confusion, I discovered
the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps approached my chamber 
door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous hand, and a light 
glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.&nbsp; I sat 
shuddering yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead: the
intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.&nbsp; At 
last, he said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an 
answer, &lsquo;Is any one here?&rsquo;&nbsp; I considered it best
to confess my presence; for I knew Heathcliff&rsquo;s accents, 
and feared he might search further, if I kept quiet.&nbsp; With 
this intention, I turned and opened the panels.&nbsp; I shall not
soon forget the effect my action produced.</p>
<p>Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers;
with a candle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as
the wall behind him.&nbsp; The first creak of the oak startled 
him like an electric shock: the light leaped from his hold to a 
distance of some feet, and his agitation was so extreme, that he 
could hardly pick it up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only your guest, sir,&rsquo; I called out, 
desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice 
further.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep,
owing to a frightful nightmare.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry I disturbed
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood!&nbsp; I wish you 
were at the&mdash;&rsquo; commenced my host, setting the candle 
on a chair, because he found it impossible to hold it 
steady.&nbsp; &lsquo;And who showed you up into this room?&rsquo;
he continued, crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his
teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who was 
it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a good mind to turn them out of the house 
this moment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was your servant Zillah,&rsquo; I replied, flinging 
myself on to the floor, and rapidly resuming my garments.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I should not care if you did, Mr. Heathcliff; she richly 
deserves it.&nbsp; I suppose that she wanted to get another proof
that the place was haunted, at my expense.&nbsp; Well, it 
is&mdash;swarming with ghosts and goblins!&nbsp; You have reason 
in shutting it up, I assure you.&nbsp; No one will thank you for 
a doze in such a den!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; asked Heathcliff, &lsquo;and 
what are you doing?&nbsp; Lie down and finish out the night, 
since you <i>are</i> here; but, for heaven&rsquo;s sake! 
don&rsquo;t repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, 
unless you were having your throat cut!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the little fiend had got in at the window, she 
probably would have strangled me!&rsquo; I returned.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to endure the persecutions of your 
hospitable ancestors again.&nbsp; Was not the Reverend Jabez 
Branderham akin to you on the mother&rsquo;s side?&nbsp; And that
minx, Catherine Linton, or Earnshaw, or however she was 
called&mdash;she must have been a changeling&mdash;wicked little 
soul!&nbsp; She told me she had been walking the earth these 
twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal transgressions, 
I&rsquo;ve no doubt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the 
association of Heathcliff&rsquo;s with Catherine&rsquo;s name in 
the book, which had completely slipped from my memory, till thus 
awakened.&nbsp; I blushed at my inconsideration: but, without 
showing further consciousness of the offence, I hastened to 
add&mdash;&lsquo;The truth is, sir, I passed the first part of 
the night in&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Here I stopped afresh&mdash;I 
was about to say &lsquo;perusing those old volumes,&rsquo; then 
it would have revealed my knowledge of their written, as well as 
their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I went 
on&mdash;&lsquo;in spelling over the name scratched on that 
window-ledge.&nbsp; A monotonous occupation, calculated to set me
asleep, like counting, or&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What <i>can</i> you mean by talking in this way to 
<i>me</i>!&rsquo; thundered Heathcliff with savage 
vehemence.&nbsp; &lsquo;How&mdash;how <i>dare</i> you, under my 
roof?&mdash;God! he&rsquo;s mad to speak so!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he 
struck his forehead with rage.</p>
<p>I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my 
explanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took 
pity and proceeded with my dreams; affirming I had never heard 
the appellation of &lsquo;Catherine Linton&rsquo; before, but 
reading it often over produced an impression which personified 
itself when I had no longer my imagination under control.&nbsp; 
Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed, as I 
spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed behind it.&nbsp; I 
guessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing, 
that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion.&nbsp;
Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict, I continued
my toilette rather noisily, looked at my watch, and soliloquised 
on the length of the night: &lsquo;Not three o&rsquo;clock 
yet!&nbsp; I could have taken oath it had been six.&nbsp; Time 
stagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at 
eight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,&rsquo; said
my host, suppressing a groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of
his arm&rsquo;s shadow, dashing a tear from his eyes.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Mr. Lockwood,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;you may go into my 
room: you&rsquo;ll only be in the way, coming down-stairs so 
early: and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for 
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And for me, too,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll walk in the yard till daylight, and then 
I&rsquo;ll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my 
intrusion.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in
society, be it country or town.&nbsp; A sensible man ought to 
find sufficient company in himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Delightful company!&rsquo; muttered Heathcliff.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Take the candle, and go where you please.&nbsp; I shall 
join you directly.&nbsp; Keep out of the yard, though, the dogs 
are unchained; and the house&mdash;Juno mounts sentinel there, 
and&mdash;nay, you can only ramble about the steps and 
passages.&nbsp; But, away with you!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come in two 
minutes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where 
the narrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, 
involuntarily, to a piece of superstition on the part of my 
landlord which belied, oddly, his apparent sense.&nbsp; He got on
to the bed, and wrenched open the lattice, bursting, as he pulled
at it, into an uncontrollable passion of tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come
in! come in!&rsquo; he sobbed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cathy, do come.&nbsp;
Oh, do&mdash;<i>once</i> more!&nbsp; Oh! my heart&rsquo;s 
darling! hear me <i>this</i> time, Catherine, at 
last!&rsquo;&nbsp; The spectre showed a spectre&rsquo;s ordinary 
caprice: it gave no sign of being; but the snow and wind whirled 
wildly through, even reaching my station, and blowing out the 
light.</p>
<p>There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied 
this raving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I
drew off, half angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having
related my ridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony; 
though <i>why</i> was beyond my comprehension.&nbsp; I descended 
cautiously to the lower regions, and landed in the back-kitchen, 
where a gleam of fire, raked compactly together, enabled me to 
rekindle my candle.&nbsp; Nothing was stirring except a brindled,
grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a 
querulous mew.</p>
<p>Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed 
the hearth; on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin 
mounted the other.&nbsp; We were both of us nodding ere any one 
invaded our retreat, and then it was Joseph, shuffling down a 
wooden ladder that vanished in the roof, through a trap: the 
ascent to his garret, I suppose.&nbsp; He cast a sinister look at
the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs, 
swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in the 
vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe 
with tobacco.&nbsp; My presence in his sanctum was evidently 
esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark: he 
silently applied the tube to his lips, folded his arms, and 
puffed away.&nbsp; I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed; and 
after sucking out his last wreath, and heaving a profound sigh, 
he got up, and departed as solemnly as he came.</p>
<p>A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my 
mouth for a &lsquo;good-morning,&rsquo; but closed it again, the 
salutation unachieved; for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his 
orison <i>sotto voce</i>, in a series of curses directed against 
every object he touched, while he rummaged a corner for a spade 
or shovel to dig through the drifts.&nbsp; He glanced over the 
back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little 
of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the 
cat.&nbsp; I guessed, by his preparations, that egress was 
allowed, and, leaving my hard couch, made a movement to follow 
him.&nbsp; He noticed this, and thrust at an inner door with the 
end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate sound that there 
was the place where I must go, if I changed my locality.</p>
<p>It opened into the house, where the females were already 
astir; Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a 
colossal bellows; and Mrs. Heathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, 
reading a book by the aid of the blaze.&nbsp; She held her hand 
interposed between the furnace-heat and her eyes, and seemed 
absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to chide the 
servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog, now 
and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her 
face.&nbsp; I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also.&nbsp; 
He stood by the fire, his back towards me, just finishing a 
stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever and anon interrupted her 
labour to pluck up the corner of her apron, and heave an 
indignant groan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you, you worthless&mdash;&rsquo; he broke out as I 
entered, turning to his daughter-in-law, and employing an epithet
as harmless as duck, or sheep, but generally represented by a 
dash&mdash;.&nbsp; &lsquo;There you are, at your idle tricks 
again!&nbsp; The rest of them do earn their bread&mdash;you live 
on my charity!&nbsp; Put your trash away, and find something to 
do.&nbsp; You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally
in my sight&mdash;do you hear, damnable jade?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put my trash away, because you can make me 
if I refuse,&rsquo; answered the young lady, closing her book, 
and throwing it on a chair.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll not do 
anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I 
please!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer 
distance, obviously acquainted with its weight.&nbsp; Having no 
desire to be entertained by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped 
forward briskly, as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth,
and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute.&nbsp; 
Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities: 
Heathcliff placed his fists, out of temptation, in his pockets; 
Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked to a seat far off, 
where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during 
the remainder of my stay.&nbsp; That was not long.&nbsp; I 
declined joining their breakfast, and, at the first gleam of 
dawn, took an opportunity of escaping into the free air, now 
clear, and still, and cold as impalpable ice.</p>
<p>My landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of
the garden, and offered to accompany me across the moor.&nbsp; It
was well he did, for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white 
ocean; the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises 
and depressions in the ground: many pits, at least, were filled 
to a level; and entire ranges of mounds, the refuse of the 
quarries, blotted from the chart which my yesterday&rsquo;s walk 
left pictured in my mind.&nbsp; I had remarked on one side of the
road, at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright 
stones, continued through the whole length of the barren: these 
were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides 
in the dark, and also when a fall, like the present, confounded 
the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path: but, 
excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there, all traces of 
their existence had vanished: and my companion found it necessary
to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left, when I 
imagined I was following, correctly, the windings of the 
road.</p>
<p>We exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the 
entrance of Thrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error 
there.&nbsp; Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow, and then I 
pushed forward, trusting to my own resources; for the 
porter&rsquo;s lodge is untenanted as yet.&nbsp; The distance 
from the gate to the grange is two miles; I believe I managed to 
make it four, what with losing myself among the trees, and 
sinking up to the neck in snow: a predicament which only those 
who have experienced it can appreciate.&nbsp; At any rate, 
whatever were my wanderings, the clock chimed twelve as I entered
the house; and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the 
usual way from Wuthering Heights.</p>
<p>My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me; 
exclaiming, tumultuously, they had completely given me up: 
everybody conjectured that I perished last night; and they were 
wondering how they must set about the search for my 
remains.&nbsp; I bid them be quiet, now that they saw me 
returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged up-stairs; 
whence, after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro 
thirty or forty minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned 
to my study, feeble as a kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the 
cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant had prepared 
for my refreshment.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>What vain weathercocks we are!&nbsp; I, who had determined to 
hold myself independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my
stars that, at length, I had lighted on a spot where it was next 
to impracticable&mdash;I, weak wretch, after maintaining till 
dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude, was finally 
compelled to strike my colours; and under pretence of gaining 
information concerning the necessities of my establishment, I 
desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit down while 
I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip, and 
either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have lived here a considerable time,&rsquo; I 
commenced; &lsquo;did you not say sixteen years?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to
wait on her; after she died, the master retained me for his 
housekeeper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There ensued a pause.&nbsp; She was not a gossip, I feared; 
unless about her own affairs, and those could hardly interest 
me.&nbsp; However, having studied for an interval, with a fist on
either knee, and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy 
countenance, she ejaculated&mdash;&lsquo;Ah, times are greatly 
changed since then!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I remarked, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve seen a good
many alterations, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have: and troubles too,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll turn the talk on my landlord&rsquo;s 
family!&rsquo; I thought to myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;A good subject 
to start!&nbsp; And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to know
her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is 
more probable, an exotic that the surly <i>indigenae</i> will not
recognise for kin.&rsquo;&nbsp; With this intention I asked Mrs. 
Dean why Heathcliff let Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living 
in a situation and residence so much inferior.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is he
not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?&rsquo; I 
inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rich, sir!&rsquo; she returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has 
nobody knows what money, and every year it increases.&nbsp; Yes, 
yes, he&rsquo;s rich enough to live in a finer house than this: 
but he&rsquo;s very near&mdash;close-handed; and, if he had meant
to flit to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good 
tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a 
few hundreds more.&nbsp; It is strange people should be so 
greedy, when they are alone in the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He had a son, it seems?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he had one&mdash;he is dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his 
widow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where did she come from originally?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, sir, she is my late master&rsquo;s daughter: 
Catherine Linton was her maiden name.&nbsp; I nursed her, poor 
thing!&nbsp; I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would remove here, and 
then we might have been together again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&nbsp; Catherine Linton?&rsquo; I exclaimed, 
astonished.&nbsp; But a minute&rsquo;s reflection convinced me it
was not my ghostly Catherine.&nbsp; Then,&rsquo; I continued, 
&lsquo;my predecessor&rsquo;s name was Linton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives 
with Mr. Heathcliff?&nbsp; Are they relations?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; he is the late Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s 
nephew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The young lady&rsquo;s cousin, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the 
mother&rsquo;s, the other on the father&rsquo;s side: Heathcliff 
married Mr. Linton&rsquo;s sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see the house at Wuthering Heights has 
&ldquo;Earnshaw&rdquo; carved over the front door.&nbsp; Are they
an old family?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our 
Miss Cathy is of us&mdash;I mean, of the Lintons.&nbsp; Have you 
been to Wuthering Heights?&nbsp; I beg pardon for asking; but I 
should like to hear how she is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Heathcliff? she looked very well, and very 
handsome; yet, I think, not very happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear, I don&rsquo;t wonder!&nbsp; And how did you 
like the master?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean.&nbsp; Is not that 
his character?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone!&nbsp; The 
less you meddle with him the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him
such a churl.&nbsp; Do you know anything of his 
history?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a cuckoo&rsquo;s, sir&mdash;I know all about
it: except where he was born, and who were his parents, and how 
he got his money at first.&nbsp; And Hareton has been cast out 
like an unfledged dunnock!&nbsp; The unfortunate lad is the only 
one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been 
cheated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell 
me something of my neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to
bed; so be good enough to sit and chat an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, certainly, sir!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just fetch a 
little sewing, and then I&rsquo;ll sit as long as you 
please.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ve caught cold: I saw you shivering, 
and you must have some gruel to drive it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; 
my head felt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was 
excited, almost to a pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and 
brain.&nbsp; This caused me to feel, not uncomfortable, but 
rather fearful (as I am still) of serious effects from the 
incidents of to-day and yesterday.&nbsp; She returned presently, 
bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having placed
the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to 
find me so companionable.</p>
<p>Before I came to live here, she commenced&mdash;waiting no 
farther invitation to her story&mdash;I was almost always at 
Wuthering Heights; because my mother had nursed Mr. Hindley 
Earnshaw, that was Hareton&rsquo;s father, and I got used to 
playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped to make 
hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody 
would set me to.&nbsp; One fine summer morning&mdash;it was the 
beginning of harvest, I remember&mdash;Mr. Earnshaw, the old 
master, came down-stairs, dressed for a journey; and, after he 
had told Joseph what was to be done during the day, he turned to 
Hindley, and Cathy, and me&mdash;for I sat eating my porridge 
with them&mdash;and he said, speaking to his son, &lsquo;Now, my 
bonny man, I&rsquo;m going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I 
bring you?&nbsp; You may choose what you like: only let it be 
little, for I shall walk there and back: sixty miles each way, 
that is a long spell!&rsquo;&nbsp; Hindley named a fiddle, and 
then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but she 
could ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip.&nbsp; 
He did not forget me; for he had a kind heart, though he was 
rather severe sometimes.&nbsp; He promised to bring me a 
pocketful of apples and pears, and then he kissed his children, 
said good-bye, and set off.</p>
<p>It seemed a long while to us all&mdash;the three days of his 
absence&mdash;and often did little Cathy ask when he would be 
home.&nbsp; Mrs. Earnshaw expected him by supper-time on the 
third evening, and she put the meal off hour after hour; there 
were no signs of his coming, however, and at last the children 
got tired of running down to the gate to look.&nbsp; Then it grew
dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to be
allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven o&rsquo;clock, the 
door-latch was raised quietly, and in stepped the master.&nbsp; 
He threw himself into a chair, laughing and groaning, and bid 
them all stand off, for he was nearly killed&mdash;he would not 
have such another walk for the three kingdoms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And at the end of it to be flighted to death!&rsquo; he
said, opening his great-coat, which he held bundled up in his 
arms.&nbsp; &lsquo;See here, wife!&nbsp; I was never so beaten 
with anything in my life: but you must e&rsquo;en take it as a 
gift of God; though it&rsquo;s as dark almost as if it came from 
the devil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy&rsquo;s head I had a 
peep at a dirty, ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to 
walk and talk: indeed, its face looked older than 
Catherine&rsquo;s; yet when it was set on its feet, it only 
stared round, and repeated over and over again some gibberish 
that nobody could understand.&nbsp; I was frightened, and Mrs. 
Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, 
asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the 
house, when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for?&nbsp;
What he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad?&nbsp; The 
master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half dead 
with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her 
scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless, 
and as good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked
it up and inquired for its owner.&nbsp; Not a soul knew to whom 
it belonged, he said; and his money and time being both limited, 
he thought it better to take it home with him at once, than run 
into vain expenses there: because he was determined he would not 
leave it as he found it.&nbsp; Well, the conclusion was, that my 
mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash 
it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep with the 
children.</p>
<p>Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and 
listening till peace was restored: then, both began searching 
their father&rsquo;s pockets for the presents he had promised 
them.&nbsp; The former was a boy of fourteen, but when he drew 
out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the great-coat,
he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she learned the master had 
lost her whip in attending on the stranger, showed her humour by 
grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing; earning for her
pains a sound blow from her father, to teach her cleaner 
manners.&nbsp; They entirely refused to have it in bed with them,
or even in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on 
the landing of the stairs, hoping it might he gone on the 
morrow.&nbsp; By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, 
it crept to Mr. Earnshaw&rsquo;s door, and there he found it on 
quitting his chamber.&nbsp; Inquiries were made as to how it got 
there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my 
cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.</p>
<p>This was Heathcliff&rsquo;s first introduction to the 
family.&nbsp; On coming back a few days afterwards (for I did not
consider my banishment perpetual), I found they had christened 
him &lsquo;Heathcliff&rsquo;: it was the name of a son who died 
in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for 
Christian and surname.&nbsp; Miss Cathy and he were now very 
thick; but Hindley hated him: and to say the truth I did the 
same; and we plagued and went on with him shamefully: for I 
wasn&rsquo;t reasonable enough to feel my injustice, and the 
mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him 
wronged.</p>
<p>He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to 
ill-treatment: he would stand Hindley&rsquo;s blows without 
winking or shedding a tear, and my pinches moved him only to draw
in a breath and open his eyes, as if he had hurt himself by 
accident, and nobody was to blame.&nbsp; This endurance made old 
Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son persecuting the poor
fatherless child, as he called him.&nbsp; He took to Heathcliff 
strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said 
precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far
above Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a 
favourite.</p>
<p>So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house;
and at Mrs. Earnshaw&rsquo;s death, which happened in less than 
two years after, the young master had learned to regard his 
father as an oppressor rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as a 
usurper of his parent&rsquo;s affections and his privileges; and 
he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries.&nbsp; I 
sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the 
measles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a 
woman at once, I changed my idea.&nbsp; Heathcliff was 
dangerously sick; and while he lay at the worst he would have me 
constantly by his pillow: I suppose he felt I did a good deal for
him, and he hadn&rsquo;t wit to guess that I was compelled to do 
it.&nbsp; However, I will say this, he was the quietest child 
that ever nurse watched over.&nbsp; The difference between him 
and the others forced me to be less partial.&nbsp; Cathy and her 
brother harassed me terribly: he was as uncomplaining as a lamb; 
though hardness, not gentleness, made him give little 
trouble.</p>
<p>He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great 
measure owing to me, and praised me for my care.&nbsp; I was vain
of his commendations, and softened towards the being by whose 
means I earned them, and thus Hindley lost his last ally: still I
couldn&rsquo;t dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered often what my 
master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy; who never, to my 
recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of 
gratitude.&nbsp; He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was 
simply insensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on 
his heart, and conscious he had only to speak and all the house 
would be obliged to bend to his wishes.&nbsp; As an instance, I 
remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish
fair, and gave the lads each one.&nbsp; Heathcliff took the 
handsomest, but it soon fell lame, and when he discovered it, he 
said to Hindley&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must exchange horses with me: I don&rsquo;t like 
mine; and if you won&rsquo;t I shall tell your father of the 
three thrashings you&rsquo;ve given me this week, and show him my
arm, which is black to the shoulder.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hindley put out
his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better do it at once,&rsquo; he persisted, 
escaping to the porch (they were in the stable): &lsquo;you will 
have to: and if I speak of these blows, you&rsquo;ll get them 
again with interest.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Off, dog!&rsquo; cried 
Hindley, threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing 
potatoes and hay.&nbsp; &lsquo;Throw it,&rsquo; he replied, 
standing still, &lsquo;and then I&rsquo;ll tell how you boasted 
that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died, and see 
whether he will not turn you out directly.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hindley 
threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he fell, but 
staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I 
prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and got 
full revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating 
who had caused it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take my colt, Gipsy, then!&rsquo;
said young Earnshaw.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I pray that he may break 
your neck: take him, and he damned, you beggarly interloper! and 
wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards show him 
what you are, imp of Satan.&mdash;And take that, I hope 
he&rsquo;ll kick out your brains!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his 
own stall; he was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his 
speech by knocking him under its feet, and without stopping to 
examine whether his hopes were fulfilled, ran away as fast as he 
could.&nbsp; I was surprised to witness how coolly the child 
gathered himself up, and went on with his intention; exchanging 
saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to 
overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he 
entered the house.&nbsp; I persuaded him easily to let me lay the
blame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale was
told since he had what he wanted.&nbsp; He complained so seldom, 
indeed, of such stirs as these, that I really thought him not 
vindictive: I was deceived completely, as you will hear.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>In the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail.&nbsp; He had
been active and healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and 
when he was confined to the chimney-corner he grew grievously 
irritable.&nbsp; A nothing vexed him; and suspected slights of 
his authority nearly threw him into fits.&nbsp; This was 
especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or
domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a 
word should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his 
head the notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and
longed to do him an ill-turn.&nbsp; It was a disadvantage to the 
lad; for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master, so 
we humoured his partiality; and that humouring was rich 
nourishment to the child&rsquo;s pride and black tempers.&nbsp; 
Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice, 
Hindley&rsquo;s manifestation of scorn, while his father was 
near, roused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike
him, and shook with rage that he could not do it.</p>
<p>At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living 
answer by teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming 
his bit of land himself) advised that the young man should be 
sent to college; and Mr. Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy 
spirit, for he said&mdash;&lsquo;Hindley was nought, and would 
never thrive as where he wandered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I hoped heartily we should have peace now.&nbsp; It hurt me to
think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good 
deed.&nbsp; I fancied the discontent of age and disease arose 
from his family disagreements; as he would have it that it did: 
really, you know, sir, it was in his sinking frame.&nbsp; We 
might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for two 
people&mdash;Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I 
daresay, up yonder.&nbsp; He was, and is yet most likely, the 
wearisomest self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible 
to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his 
neighbours.&nbsp; By his knack of sermonising and pious 
discoursing, he contrived to make a great impression on Mr. 
Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more 
influence he gained.&nbsp; He was relentless in worrying him 
about his soul&rsquo;s concerns, and about ruling his children 
rigidly.&nbsp; He encouraged him to regard Hindley as a 
reprobate; and, night after night, he regularly grumbled out a 
long string of tales against Heathcliff and Catherine: always 
minding to flatter Earnshaw&rsquo;s weakness by heaping the 
heaviest blame on the latter.</p>
<p>Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child 
take up before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty 
times and oftener in a day: from the hour she came down-stairs 
till the hour she went to bed, we had not a minute&rsquo;s 
security that she wouldn&rsquo;t be in mischief.&nbsp; Her 
spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always 
going&mdash;singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would 
not do the same.&nbsp; A wild, wicked slip she was&mdash;but she 
had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile, and lightest foot in 
the parish: and, after all, I believe she meant no harm; for when
once she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened that 
she would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet that 
you might comfort her.&nbsp; She was much too fond of 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; The greatest punishment we could invent for her
was to keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than 
any of us on his account.&nbsp; In play, she liked exceedingly to
act the little mistress; using her hands freely, and commanding 
her companions: she did so to me, but I would not bear slapping 
and ordering; and so I let her know.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: 
he had always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on 
her part, had no idea why her father should be crosser and less 
patient in his ailing condition than he was in his prime.&nbsp; 
His peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke 
him: she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at 
once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy look, and her ready
words; turning Joseph&rsquo;s religious curses into ridicule, 
baiting me, and doing just what her father hated 
most&mdash;showing how her pretended insolence, which he thought 
real, had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness: how the 
boy would do <i>her</i> bidding in anything, and <i>his</i> only 
when it suited his own inclination.&nbsp; After behaving as badly
as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to make it up at
night.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, Cathy,&rsquo; the old man would say, 
&lsquo;I cannot love thee, thou&rsquo;rt worse than thy 
brother.&nbsp; Go, say thy prayers, child, and ask God&rsquo;s 
pardon.&nbsp; I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever 
reared thee!&rsquo;&nbsp; That made her cry, at first; and then 
being repulsed continually hardened her, and she laughed if I 
told her to say she was sorry for her faults, and beg to be 
forgiven.</p>
<p>But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw&rsquo;s 
troubles on earth.&nbsp; He died quietly in his chair one October
evening, seated by the fire-side.&nbsp; A high wind blustered 
round the house, and roared in the chimney: it sounded wild and 
stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were all together&mdash;I, a 
little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting, and Joseph 
reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally sat 
in the house then, after their work was done).&nbsp; Miss Cathy 
had been sick, and that made her still; she leant against her 
father&rsquo;s knee, and Heathcliff was lying on the floor with 
his head in her lap.&nbsp; I remember the master, before he fell 
into a doze, stroking her bonny hair&mdash;it pleased him rarely 
to see her gentle&mdash;and saying, &lsquo;Why canst thou not 
always be a good lass, Cathy?&rsquo;&nbsp; And she turned her 
face up to his, and laughed, and answered, &lsquo;Why cannot you 
always be a good man, father?&rsquo;&nbsp; But as soon as she saw
him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said she would sing him
to sleep.&nbsp; She began singing very low, till his fingers 
dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast.&nbsp; Then I 
told her to hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake 
him.&nbsp; We all kept as mute as mice a full half-hour, and 
should have done so longer, only Joseph, having finished his 
chapter, got up and said that he must rouse the master for 
prayers and bed.&nbsp; He stepped forward, and called him by 
name, and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took
the candle and looked at him.&nbsp; I thought there was something
wrong as he set down the light; and seizing the children each by 
an arm, whispered them to &lsquo;frame up-stairs, and make little
din&mdash;they might pray alone that evening&mdash;he had summut 
to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall bid father good-night first,&rsquo; said 
Catherine, putting her arms round his neck, before we could 
hinder her.&nbsp; The poor thing discovered her loss 
directly&mdash;she screamed out&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s dead,
Heathcliff! he&rsquo;s dead!&rsquo;&nbsp; And they both set up a 
heart-breaking cry.</p>
<p>I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked 
what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in 
heaven.&nbsp; He told me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton 
for the doctor and the parson.&nbsp; I could not guess the use 
that either would be of, then.&nbsp; However, I went, through 
wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with me; the 
other said he would come in the morning.&nbsp; Leaving Joseph to 
explain matters, I ran to the children&rsquo;s room: their door 
was ajar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past 
midnight; but they were calmer, and did not need me to console 
them.&nbsp; The little souls were comforting each other with 
better thoughts than I could have hit on: no parson in the world 
ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did, in their 
innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could not help
wishing we were all there safe together.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and&mdash;a thing that 
amazed us, and set the neighbours gossiping right and 
left&mdash;he brought a wife with him.&nbsp; What she was, and 
where she was born, he never informed us: probably, she had 
neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely 
have kept the union from his father.</p>
<p>She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on 
her own account.&nbsp; Every object she saw, the moment she 
crossed the threshold, appeared to delight her; and every 
circumstance that took place about her: except the preparing for 
the burial, and the presence of the mourners.&nbsp; I thought she
was half silly, from her behaviour while that went on: she ran 
into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I should have
been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and 
clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly&mdash;&lsquo;Are they 
gone yet?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she began describing with hysterical 
emotion the effect it produced on her to see black; and started, 
and trembled, and, at last, fell a-weeping&mdash;and when I asked
what was the matter, answered, she didn&rsquo;t know; but she 
felt so afraid of dying!&nbsp; I imagined her as little likely to
die as myself.&nbsp; She was rather thin, but young, and 
fresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as 
diamonds.&nbsp; I did remark, to be sure, that mounting the 
stairs made her breathe very quick; that the least sudden noise 
set her all in a quiver, and that she coughed troublesomely 
sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these symptoms portended, 
and had no impulse to sympathise with her.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t 
in general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they 
take to us first.</p>
<p>Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of 
his absence.&nbsp; He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and 
spoke and dressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his 
return, he told Joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter 
ourselves in the back-kitchen, and leave the house for him.&nbsp;
Indeed, he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for
a parlour; but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white 
floor and huge glowing fireplace, at the pewter dishes and 
delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was to move 
about in where they usually sat, that he thought it unnecessary 
to her comfort, and so dropped the intention.</p>
<p>She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new
acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and 
ran about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the 
beginning.&nbsp; Her affection tired very soon, however, and when
she grew peevish, Hindley became tyrannical.&nbsp; A few words 
from her, evincing a dislike to Heathcliff, were enough to rouse 
in him all his old hatred of the boy.&nbsp; He drove him from 
their company to the servants, deprived him of the instructions 
of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of doors 
instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the 
farm.</p>
<p>Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because 
Cathy taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him 
in the fields.&nbsp; They both promised fair to grow up as rude 
as savages; the young master being entirely negligent how they 
behaved, and what they did, so they kept clear of him.&nbsp; He 
would not even have seen after their going to church on Sundays, 
only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they
absented themselves; and that reminded him to order Heathcliff a 
flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper.&nbsp; But 
it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in 
the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment 
grew a mere thing to laugh at.&nbsp; The curate might set as many
chapters as he pleased for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph 
might thrash Heathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot 
everything the minute they were together again: at least the 
minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge; and many 
a time I&rsquo;ve cried to myself to watch them growing more 
reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable, for fear of
losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended 
creatures.&nbsp; One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were 
banished from the sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light 
offence of the kind; and when I went to call them to supper, I 
could discover them nowhere.&nbsp; We searched the house, above 
and below, and the yard and stables; they were invisible: and, at
last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors, and swore 
nobody should let them in that night.&nbsp; The household went to
bed; and I, too, anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put 
my head out to hearken, though it rained: determined to admit 
them in spite of the prohibition, should they return.&nbsp; In a 
while, I distinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of
a lantern glimmered through the gate.&nbsp; I threw a shawl over 
my head and ran to prevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by 
knocking.&nbsp; There was Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a 
start to see him alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is Miss Catherine?&rsquo; I cried 
hurriedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;No accident, I hope?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;At Thrushcross Grange,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;and I 
would have been there too, but they had not the manners to ask me
to stay.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, you will catch it!&rsquo; I 
said: &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll never be content till you&rsquo;re sent
about your business.&nbsp; What in the world led you wandering to
Thrushcross Grange?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me get off my wet 
clothes, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it, Nelly,&rsquo; he 
replied.&nbsp; I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while 
he undressed and I waited to put out the candle, he 
continued&mdash;&lsquo;Cathy and I escaped from the wash-house to
have a ramble at liberty, and getting a glimpse of the Grange 
lights, we thought we would just go and see whether the Lintons 
passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in corners, while
their father and mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and 
laughing, and burning their eyes out before the fire.&nbsp; Do 
you think they do?&nbsp; Or reading sermons, and being catechised
by their manservant, and set to learn a column of Scripture 
names, if they don&rsquo;t answer properly?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Probably not,&rsquo; I responded.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are 
good children, no doubt, and don&rsquo;t deserve the treatment 
you receive, for your bad conduct.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cant, Nelly,&rsquo; he said: 
&lsquo;nonsense!&nbsp; We ran from the top of the Heights to the 
park, without stopping&mdash;Catherine completely beaten in the 
race, because she was barefoot.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to seek 
for her shoes in the bog to-morrow.&nbsp; We crept through a 
broken hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves 
on a flower-plot under the drawing-room window.&nbsp; The light 
came from thence; they had not put up the shutters, and the 
curtains were only half closed.&nbsp; Both of us were able to 
look in by standing on the basement, and clinging to the ledge, 
and we saw&mdash;ah! it was beautiful&mdash;a splendid place 
carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and
a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops 
hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with 
little soft tapers.&nbsp; Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there;
Edgar and his sisters had it entirely to themselves.&nbsp; 
Shouldn&rsquo;t they have been happy?&nbsp; We should have 
thought ourselves in heaven!&nbsp; And now, guess what your good 
children were doing?&nbsp; Isabella&mdash;I believe she is 
eleven, a year younger than Cathy&mdash;lay screaming at the 
farther end of the room, shrieking as if witches were running 
red-hot needles into her.&nbsp; Edgar stood on the hearth weeping
silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little dog, 
shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual 
accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between 
them.&nbsp; The idiots!&nbsp; That was their pleasure! to quarrel
who should hold a heap of warm hair, and each begin to cry 
because both, after struggling to get it, refused to take 
it.&nbsp; We laughed outright at the petted things; we did 
despise them!&nbsp; When would you catch me wishing to have what 
Catherine wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment 
in yelling, and sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by 
the whole room?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d not exchange, for a thousand 
lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton&rsquo;s at Thrushcross
Grange&mdash;not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph
off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with 
Hindley&rsquo;s blood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush!&rsquo; I interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still 
you have not told me, Heathcliff, how Catherine is left 
behind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you we laughed,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;The Lintons heard us, and with one accord they shot like 
arrows to the door; there was silence, and then a cry, &ldquo;Oh,
mamma, mamma!&nbsp; Oh, papa!&nbsp; Oh, mamma, come here.&nbsp; 
Oh, papa, oh!&rdquo;&nbsp; They really did howl out something in 
that way.&nbsp; We made frightful noises to terrify them still 
more, and then we dropped off the ledge, because somebody was 
drawing the bars, and we felt we had better flee.&nbsp; I had 
Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all at once she 
fell down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Run, Heathcliff, run!&rdquo; she 
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have let the bull-dog loose, and he 
holds me!&rdquo;&nbsp; The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly: I 
heard his abominable snorting.&nbsp; She did not yell 
out&mdash;no! she would have scorned to do it, if she had been 
spitted on the horns of a mad cow.&nbsp; I did, though: I 
vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in Christendom;
and I got a stone and thrust it between his jaws, and tried with 
all my might to cram it down his throat.&nbsp; A beast of a 
servant came up with a lantern, at last, 
shouting&mdash;&ldquo;Keep fast, Skulker, keep fast!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He changed his note, however, when he saw Skulker&rsquo;s 
game.&nbsp; The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple tongue 
hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips 
streaming with bloody slaver.&nbsp; The man took Cathy up; she 
was sick: not from fear, I&rsquo;m certain, but from pain.&nbsp; 
He carried her in; I followed, grumbling execrations and 
vengeance.&nbsp; &ldquo;What prey, Robert?&rdquo; hallooed Linton
from the entrance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Skulker has caught a little girl,
sir,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s a lad 
here,&rdquo; he added, making a clutch at me, &ldquo;who looks an
out-and-outer!&nbsp; Very like the robbers were for putting them 
through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were 
asleep, that they might murder us at their ease.&nbsp; Hold your 
tongue, you foul-mouthed thief, you! you shall go to the gallows 
for this.&nbsp; Mr. Linton, sir, don&rsquo;t lay by your 
gun.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, Robert,&rdquo; said the old 
fool.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rascals knew that yesterday was my 
rent-day: they thought to have me cleverly.&nbsp; Come in; 
I&rsquo;ll furnish them a reception.&nbsp; There, John, fasten 
the chain.&nbsp; Give Skulker some water, Jenny.&nbsp; To beard a
magistrate in his stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too!&nbsp; 
Where will their insolence stop?&nbsp; Oh, my dear Mary, look 
here!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afraid, it is but a boy&mdash;yet the 
villain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness
to the country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in
acts as well as features?&rdquo;&nbsp; He pulled me under the 
chandelier, and Mrs. Linton placed her spectacles on her nose and
raised her hands in horror.&nbsp; The cowardly children crept 
nearer also, Isabella lisping&mdash;&ldquo;Frightful thing!&nbsp;
Put him in the cellar, papa.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s exactly like the 
son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant.&nbsp; 
Isn&rsquo;t he, Edgar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the
last speech, and laughed.&nbsp; Edgar Linton, after an 
inquisitive stare, collected sufficient wit to recognise 
her.&nbsp; They see us at church, you know, though we seldom meet
them elsewhere.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Miss Earnshaw?&rdquo; 
he whispered to his mother, &ldquo;and look how Skulker has 
bitten her&mdash;how her foot bleeds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Miss Earnshaw?&nbsp; Nonsense!&rdquo; cried the 
dame; &ldquo;Miss Earnshaw scouring the country with a 
gipsy!&nbsp; And yet, my dear, the child is in 
mourning&mdash;surely it is&mdash;and she may be lamed for 
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What culpable carelessness in her 
brother!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Linton, turning from me to 
Catherine.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve understood from 
Shielders&rdquo;&rsquo; (that was the curate, sir) 
&lsquo;&ldquo;that he lets her grow up in absolute 
heathenism.&nbsp; But who is this?&nbsp; Where did she pick up 
this companion?&nbsp; Oho! I declare he is that strange 
acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey to 
Liverpool&mdash;a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish 
castaway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A wicked boy, at all events,&rdquo; remarked the
old lady, &ldquo;and quite unfit for a decent house!&nbsp; Did 
you notice his language, Linton?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m shocked that my 
children should have heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I recommenced cursing&mdash;don&rsquo;t be angry, 
Nelly&mdash;and so Robert was ordered to take me off.&nbsp; I 
refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the garden, 
pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw 
should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march 
directly, secured the door again.&nbsp; The curtains were still 
looped up at one corner, and I resumed my station as spy; 
because, if Catherine had wished to return, I intended shattering
their great glass panes to a million of fragments, unless they 
let her out.&nbsp; She sat on the sofa quietly.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton
took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we had borrowed 
for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with her, I
suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction 
between her treatment and mine.&nbsp; Then the woman-servant 
brought a basin of warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. 
Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and Isabella emptied a plateful 
of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood gaping at a 
distance.&nbsp; Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful 
hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her 
to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing 
her food between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she 
pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant 
blue eyes of the Lintons&mdash;a dim reflection from her own 
enchanting face.&nbsp; I saw they were full of stupid admiration;
she is so immeasurably superior to them&mdash;to everybody on 
earth, is she not, Nelly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There will more come of this business than you reckon 
on,&rsquo; I answered, covering him up and extinguishing the 
light.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are incurable, Heathcliff; and Mr. 
Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if he 
won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&nbsp; My words came truer than I 
desired.&nbsp; The luckless adventure made Earnshaw 
furious.&nbsp; And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a 
visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a 
lecture on the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to 
look about him, in earnest.&nbsp; Heathcliff received no 
flogging, but he was told that the first word he spoke to Miss 
Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs. Earnshaw undertook 
to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint when she returned 
home; employing art, not force: with force she would have found 
it impossible.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till 
Christmas.&nbsp; By that time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and
her manners much improved.&nbsp; The mistress visited her often 
in the interval, and commenced her plan of reform by trying to 
raise her self-respect with fine clothes and flattery, which she 
took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless little savage 
jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all breathless,
there &lsquo;lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified 
person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered
beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up 
with both hands that she might sail in.&nbsp; Hindley lifted her 
from her horse, exclaiming delightedly, &lsquo;Why, Cathy, you 
are quite a beauty!&nbsp; I should scarcely have known you: you 
look like a lady now.&nbsp; Isabella Linton is not to be compared
with her, is she, Frances?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Isabella has not 
her natural advantages,&rsquo; replied his wife: &lsquo;but she 
must mind and not grow wild again here.&nbsp; Ellen, help Miss 
Catherine off with her things&mdash;Stay, dear, you will 
disarrange your curls&mdash;let me untie your hat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand 
plaid silk frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while
her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to 
welcome her, she dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn 
upon her splendid garments.&nbsp; She kissed me gently: I was all
flour making the Christmas cake, and it would not have done to 
give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff.&nbsp; 
Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking 
it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they
had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.</p>
<p>Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first.&nbsp; If he were 
careless, and uncared for, before Catherine&rsquo;s absence, he 
had been ten times more so since.&nbsp; Nobody but I even did him
the kindness to call him a dirty boy, and bid him wash himself, 
once a week; and children of his age seldom have a natural 
pleasure in soap and water.&nbsp; Therefore, not to mention his 
clothes, which had seen three months&rsquo; service in mire and 
dust, and his thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and 
hands was dismally beclouded.&nbsp; He might well skulk behind 
the settle, on beholding such a bright, graceful damsel enter the
house, instead of a rough-headed counterpart of himself, as he 
expected.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is Heathcliff not here?&rsquo; she 
demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers 
wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff, you may come forward,&rsquo; cried Mr. 
Hindley, enjoying his discomfiture, and gratified to see what a 
forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present 
himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;You may come and wish Miss Catherine 
welcome, like the other servants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, 
flew to embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his 
cheek within the second, and then stopped, and drawing back, 
burst into a laugh, exclaiming, &lsquo;Why, how very black and 
cross you look! and how&mdash;how funny and grim!&nbsp; But 
that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m used to Edgar and Isabella 
Linton.&nbsp; Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride 
threw double gloom over his countenance, and kept him 
immovable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shake hands, Heathcliff,&rsquo; said Mr. Earnshaw, 
condescendingly; &lsquo;once in a way, that is 
permitted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not,&rsquo; replied the boy, finding his tongue
at last; &lsquo;I shall not stand to be laughed at.&nbsp; I shall
not bear it!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he would have broken from the 
circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not mean to laugh at you,&rsquo; she said; 
&lsquo;I could not hinder myself: Heathcliff, shake hands at 
least!&nbsp; What are you sulky for?&nbsp; It was only that you 
looked odd.&nbsp; If you wash your face and brush your hair, it 
will be all right: but you are so dirty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her 
own, and also at her dress; which she feared had gained no 
embellishment from its contact with his.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t have touched me!&rsquo; he answered, 
following her eye and snatching away his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
shall be as dirty as I please: and I like to be dirty, and I will
be dirty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the 
merriment of the master and mistress, and to the serious 
disturbance of Catherine; who could not comprehend how her 
remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad 
temper.</p>
<p>After playing lady&rsquo;s-maid to the new-comer, and putting 
my cakes in the oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful 
with great fires, befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down
and amuse myself by singing carols, all alone; regardless of 
Joseph&rsquo;s affirmations that he considered the merry tunes I 
chose as next door to songs.&nbsp; He had retired to private 
prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging 
Missy&rsquo;s attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to 
present to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their 
kindness.&nbsp; They had invited them to spend the morrow at 
Wuthering Heights, and the invitation had been accepted, on one 
condition: Mrs. Linton begged that her darlings might be kept 
carefully apart from that &lsquo;naughty swearing boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I remained solitary.&nbsp; I smelt 
the rich scent of the heating spices; and admired the shining 
kitchen utensils, the polished clock, decked in holly, the silver
mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for 
supper; and above all, the speckless purity of my particular 
care&mdash;the scoured and well-swept floor.&nbsp; I gave due 
inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old 
Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant 
lass, and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and 
from that I went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and 
his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed 
him: and that naturally led me to consider the poor lad&rsquo;s 
situation now, and from singing I changed my mind to 
crying.&nbsp; It struck me soon, however, there would be more 
sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding 
tears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek 
him.&nbsp; He was not far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat 
of the new pony in the stable, and feeding the other beasts, 
according to custom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make haste, Heathcliff!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;the 
kitchen is so comfortable; and Joseph is up-stairs: make haste, 
and let me dress you smart before Miss Cathy comes out, and then 
you can sit together, with the whole hearth to yourselves, and 
have a long chatter till bedtime.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards 
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come&mdash;are you coming?&rsquo; I continued.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a little cake for each of you, nearly 
enough; and you&rsquo;ll need half-an-hour&rsquo;s 
donning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him.&nbsp; 
Catherine supped with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I
joined at an unsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side 
and sauciness on the other.&nbsp; His cake and cheese remained on
the table all night for the fairies.&nbsp; He managed to continue
work till nine o&rsquo;clock, and then marched dumb and dour to 
his chamber.&nbsp; Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to
order for the reception of her new friends: she came into the 
kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she 
only stayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went 
back.&nbsp; In the morning he rose early; and, as it was a 
holiday, carried his ill-humour on to the moors; not re-appearing
till the family were departed for church.&nbsp; Fasting and 
reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit.&nbsp; 
He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his courage, 
exclaimed abruptly&mdash;&lsquo;Nelly, make me decent, I&rsquo;m 
going to be good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;High time, Heathcliff,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;you 
<i>have</i> grieved Catherine: she&rsquo;s sorry she ever came 
home, I daresay!&nbsp; It looks as if you envied her, because she
is more thought of than you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The notion of <i>envying</i> Catherine was incomprehensible to
him, but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly 
enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she say she was grieved?&rsquo; he inquired, 
looking very serious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She cried when I told her you were off again this 
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, <i>I</i> cried last night,&rsquo; he returned, 
&lsquo;and I had more reason to cry than she.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud 
heart and an empty stomach,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Proud 
people breed sad sorrows for themselves.&nbsp; But, if you be 
ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she 
comes in.&nbsp; You must go up and offer to kiss her, and 
say&mdash;you know best what to say; only do it heartily, and not
as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand 
dress.&nbsp; And now, though I have dinner to get ready, 
I&rsquo;ll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar Linton shall 
look quite a doll beside you: and that he does.&nbsp; You are 
younger, and yet, I&rsquo;ll be bound, you are taller and twice 
as broad across the shoulders; you could knock him down in a 
twinkling; don&rsquo;t you feel that you could?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff&rsquo;s face brightened a moment; then it was 
overcast afresh, and he sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that 
wouldn&rsquo;t make him less handsome or me more so.&nbsp; I wish
I had light hair and a fair skin, and was dressed and behaved as 
well, and had a chance of being as rich as he will be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And cried for mamma at every turn,&rsquo; I added, 
&lsquo;and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you,
and sat at home all day for a shower of rain.&nbsp; Oh, 
Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit!&nbsp; Come to the 
glass, and I&rsquo;ll let you see what you should wish.&nbsp; Do 
you mark those two lines between your eyes; and those thick 
brows, that, instead of rising arched, sink in the middle; and 
that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried, who never open 
their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like 
devil&rsquo;s spies?&nbsp; Wish and learn to smooth away the 
surly wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends
to confident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, 
and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to 
know the kicks it gets are its desert, and yet hates all the 
world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton&rsquo;s 
great blue eyes and even forehead,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I do&mdash;and that won&rsquo;t help me to 
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my 
lad,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;if you were a regular black; and 
a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than 
ugly.&nbsp; And now that we&rsquo;ve done washing, and combing, 
and sulking&mdash;tell me whether you don&rsquo;t think yourself 
rather handsome?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you, I do.&nbsp; 
You&rsquo;re fit for a prince in disguise.&nbsp; Who knows but 
your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian 
queen, each of them able to buy up, with one week&rsquo;s income,
Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange together?&nbsp; And you 
were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England.&nbsp; 
Were I in your place, I would frame high notions of my birth; and
the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and dignity to 
support the oppressions of a little farmer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and
began to look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation 
was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and 
entering the court.&nbsp; He ran to the window and I to the door,
just in time to behold the two Lintons descend from the family 
carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the Earnshaws 
dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in 
winter.&nbsp; Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and 
brought them into the house and set them before the fire, which 
quickly put colour into their white faces.</p>
<p>I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable 
humour, and he willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that,
as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side, 
Hindley opened it on the other.&nbsp; They met, and the master, 
irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or, perhaps, eager to
keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved him back with a sudden 
thrust, and angrily bade Joseph &lsquo;keep the fellow out of the
room&mdash;send him into the garret till dinner is over.&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;ll be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the
fruit, if left alone with them a minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, sir,&rsquo; I could not avoid answering, 
&lsquo;he&rsquo;ll touch nothing, not he: and I suppose he must 
have his share of the dainties as well as we.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him 
downstairs till dark,&rsquo; cried Hindley.&nbsp; &lsquo;Begone, 
you vagabond!&nbsp; What! you are attempting the coxcomb, are 
you?&nbsp; Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks&mdash;see 
if I won&rsquo;t pull them a bit longer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are long enough already,&rsquo; observed Master 
Linton, peeping from the doorway; &lsquo;I wonder they 
don&rsquo;t make his head ache.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like a 
colt&rsquo;s mane over his eyes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s violent nature was not prepared to endure the 
appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even 
then, as a rival.&nbsp; He seized a tureen of hot apple sauce 
(the first thing that came under his gripe) and dashed it full 
against the speaker&rsquo;s face and neck; who instantly 
commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying 
to the place.&nbsp; Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly
and conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he 
administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he 
appeared red and breathless.&nbsp; I got the dishcloth, and 
rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar&rsquo;s nose and mouth, 
affirming it served him right for meddling.&nbsp; His sister 
began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded, blushing
for all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not have spoken to him!&rsquo; she 
expostulated with Master Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was in a bad 
temper, and now you&rsquo;ve spoilt your visit; and he&rsquo;ll 
be flogged: I hate him to be flogged!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t eat my 
dinner.&nbsp; Why did you speak to him, Edgar?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; sobbed the youth, escaping from 
my hands, and finishing the remainder of the purification with 
his cambric pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp; &lsquo;I promised mamma 
that I wouldn&rsquo;t say one word to him, and I 
didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t cry,&rsquo; replied Catherine, 
contemptuously; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re not killed.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet!&nbsp; Hush, 
Isabella!&nbsp; Has anybody hurt you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, there, children&mdash;to your seats!&rsquo; 
cried Hindley, bustling in.&nbsp; &lsquo;That brute of a lad has 
warmed me nicely.&nbsp; Next time, Master Edgar, take the law 
into your own fists&mdash;it will give you an 
appetite!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the 
fragrant feast.&nbsp; They were hungry after their ride, and 
easily consoled, since no real harm had befallen them.&nbsp; Mr. 
Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, and the mistress made them 
merry with lively talk.&nbsp; I waited behind her chair, and was 
pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an indifferent air,
commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;An unfeeling child,&rsquo; I thought to myself; &lsquo;how
lightly she dismisses her old playmate&rsquo;s troubles.&nbsp; I 
could not have imagined her to be so selfish.&rsquo;&nbsp; She 
lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down again: her 
cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them.&nbsp; She slipped
her fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to 
conceal her emotion.&nbsp; I did not call her unfeeling long; for
I perceived she was in purgatory throughout the day, and wearying
to find an opportunity of getting by herself, or paying a visit 
to Heathcliff, who had been locked up by the master: as I 
discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a private mess of
victuals.</p>
<p>In the evening we had a dance.&nbsp; Cathy begged that he 
might be liberated then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her 
entreaties were vain, and I was appointed to supply the 
deficiency.&nbsp; We got rid of all gloom in the excitement of 
the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of 
the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a 
trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, 
besides singers.&nbsp; They go the rounds of all the respectable 
houses, and receive contributions every Christmas, and we 
esteemed it a first-rate treat to hear them.&nbsp; After the 
usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs and glees.&nbsp;
Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.</p>
<p>Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at 
the top of the steps, and she went up in the dark: I 
followed.&nbsp; They shut the house door below, never noting our 
absence, it was so full of people.&nbsp; She made no stay at the 
stairs&rsquo;-head, but mounted farther, to the garret where 
Heathcliff was confined, and called him.&nbsp; He stubbornly 
declined answering for a while: she persevered, and finally 
persuaded him to hold communion with her through the 
boards.&nbsp; I let the poor things converse unmolested, till I 
supposed the songs were going to cease, and the singers to get 
some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to warn 
her.&nbsp; Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice 
within.&nbsp; The little monkey had crept by the skylight of one 
garret, along the roof, into the skylight of the other, and it 
was with the utmost difficulty I could coax her out again.&nbsp; 
When she did come, Heathcliff came with her, and she insisted 
that I should take him into the kitchen, as my fellow-servant had
gone to a neighbour&rsquo;s, to be removed from the sound of our 
&lsquo;devil&rsquo;s psalmody,&rsquo; as it pleased him to call 
it.&nbsp; I told them I intended by no means to encourage their 
tricks: but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since 
yesterday&rsquo;s dinner, I would wink at his cheating Mr. 
Hindley that once.&nbsp; He went down: I set him a stool by the 
fire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick 
and could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were 
thrown away.&nbsp; He leant his two elbows on his knees, and his 
chin on his hands and remained rapt in dumb meditation.&nbsp; On 
my inquiring the subject of his thoughts, he answered 
gravely&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m trying to settle how I shall pay 
Hindley back.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care how long I wait, if I can 
only do it at last.&nbsp; I hope he will not die before I 
do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame, Heathcliff!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;It 
is for God to punish wicked people; we should learn to 
forgive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, God won&rsquo;t have the satisfaction that I 
shall,&rsquo; he returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;I only wish I knew the 
best way!&nbsp; Let me alone, and I&rsquo;ll plan it out: while 
I&rsquo;m thinking of that I don&rsquo;t feel pain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert 
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m annoyed how I should dream of chattering on 
at such a rate; and your gruel cold, and you nodding for 
bed!&nbsp; I could have told Heathcliff&rsquo;s history, all that
you need hear, in half a dozen words.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded
to lay aside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the 
hearth, and I was very far from nodding.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sit still, 
Mrs. Dean,&rsquo; I cried; &lsquo;do sit still another 
half-hour.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve done just right to tell the story 
leisurely.&nbsp; That is the method I like; and you must finish 
it in the same style.&nbsp; I am interested in every character 
you have mentioned, more or less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No matter&mdash;I&rsquo;m not accustomed to go to bed 
in the long hours.&nbsp; One or two is early enough for a person 
who lies till ten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t lie till ten.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s 
the very prime of the morning gone long before that time.&nbsp; A
person who has not done one-half his day&rsquo;s work by ten 
o&rsquo;clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half 
undone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because 
to-morrow I intend lengthening the night till afternoon.&nbsp; I 
prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold, at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not, sir.&nbsp; Well, you must allow me to leap 
over some three years; during that space Mrs. 
Earnshaw&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, I&rsquo;ll allow nothing of the sort!&nbsp; Are
you acquainted with the mood of mind in which, if you were seated
alone, and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you, you 
would watch the operation so intently that puss&rsquo;s neglect 
of one ear would put you seriously out of temper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A terribly lazy mood, I should say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the contrary, a tiresomely active one.&nbsp; It is 
mine, at present; and, therefore, continue minutely.&nbsp; I 
perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in 
towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does over a spider in 
a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the deepened 
attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the 
looker-on.&nbsp; They <i>do</i> live more in earnest, more in 
themselves, and less in surface, change, and frivolous external 
things.&nbsp; I could fancy a love for life here almost possible;
and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a year&rsquo;s 
standing.&nbsp; One state resembles setting a hungry man down to 
a single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite 
and do it justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out
by French cooks: he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from 
the whole; but each part is a mere atom in his regard and 
remembrance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get
to know us,&rsquo; observed Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my 
speech.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; I responded; &lsquo;you, my good 
friend, are a striking evidence against that assertion.&nbsp; 
Excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence, you have no
marks of the manners which I am habituated to consider as 
peculiar to your class.&nbsp; I am sure you have thought a great 
deal more than the generality of servants think.&nbsp; You have 
been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of
occasions for frittering your life away in silly 
trifles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dean laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of 
body,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;not exactly from living among the 
hills and seeing one set of faces, and one series of actions, 
from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end; but I have undergone 
sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then, I have 
read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood.&nbsp; You could not
open a book in this library that I have not looked into, and got 
something out of also: unless it be that range of Greek and 
Latin, and that of French; and those I know one from another: it 
is as much as you can expect of a poor man&rsquo;s 
daughter.&nbsp; However, if I am to follow my story in true 
gossip&rsquo;s fashion, I had better go on; and instead of 
leaping three years, I will be content to pass to the next 
summer&mdash;the summer of 1778, that is nearly twenty-three 
years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>On the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little 
nursling, and the last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was 
born.&nbsp; We were busy with the hay in a far-away field, when 
the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour
too soon across the meadow and up the lane, calling me as she 
ran.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, such a grand bairn!&rsquo; she panted out.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;The finest lad that ever breathed!&nbsp; But the doctor 
says missis must go: he says she&rsquo;s been in a consumption 
these many months.&nbsp; I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now 
she has nothing to keep her, and she&rsquo;ll be dead before 
winter.&nbsp; You must come home directly.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re to 
nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar and milk, and take care of
it day and night.&nbsp; I wish I were you, because it will be all
yours when there is no missis!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But is she very ill?&rsquo; I asked, flinging down my 
rake and tying my bonnet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,&rsquo; replied 
the girl, &lsquo;and she talks as if she thought of living to see
it grow a man.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s out of her head for joy, 
it&rsquo;s such a beauty!&nbsp; If I were her I&rsquo;m certain I
should not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in 
spite of Kenneth.&nbsp; I was fairly mad at him.&nbsp; Dame 
Archer brought the cherub down to master, in the house, and his 
face just began to light up, when the old croaker steps forward, 
and says he&mdash;&ldquo;Earnshaw, it&rsquo;s a blessing your 
wife has been spared to leave you this son.&nbsp; When she came, 
I felt convinced we shouldn&rsquo;t keep her long; and now, I 
must tell you, the winter will probably finish her.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t take on, and fret about it too much: it can&rsquo;t 
be helped.&nbsp; And besides, you should have known better than 
to choose such a rush of a lass!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what did the master answer?&rsquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think he swore: but I didn&rsquo;t mind him, I was 
straining to see the bairn,&rsquo; and she began again to 
describe it rapturously.&nbsp; I, as zealous as herself, hurried 
eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was very sad for 
Hindley&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; He had room in his heart only for two
idols&mdash;his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored 
one, and I couldn&rsquo;t conceive how he would bear the 
loss.</p>
<p>When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front 
door; and, as I passed in, I asked, &lsquo;how was the 
baby?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nearly ready to run about, Nell!&rsquo; he replied, 
putting on a cheerful smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the mistress?&rsquo; I ventured to inquire; 
&lsquo;the doctor says she&rsquo;s&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn the doctor!&rsquo; he interrupted, 
reddening.&nbsp; &lsquo;Frances is quite right: she&rsquo;ll be 
perfectly well by this time next week.&nbsp; Are you going 
up-stairs? will you tell her that I&rsquo;ll come, if 
she&rsquo;ll promise not to talk.&nbsp; I left her because she 
would not hold her tongue; and she must&mdash;tell her Mr. 
Kenneth says she must be quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in 
flighty spirits, and replied merrily, &lsquo;I hardly spoke a 
word, Ellen, and there he has gone out twice, crying.&nbsp; Well,
say I promise I won&rsquo;t speak: but that does not bind me not 
to laugh at him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor soul!&nbsp; Till within a week of her death that gay 
heart never failed her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, 
furiously, in affirming her health improved every day.&nbsp; When
Kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage 
of the malady, and he needn&rsquo;t put him to further expense by
attending her, he retorted, &lsquo;I know you need 
not&mdash;she&rsquo;s well&mdash;she does not want any more 
attendance from you!&nbsp; She never was in a consumption.&nbsp; 
It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse is as slow as mine now,
and her cheek as cool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe 
him; but one night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of 
saying she thought she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit 
of coughing took her&mdash;a very slight one&mdash;he raised her 
in his arms; she put her two hands about his neck, her face 
changed, and she was dead.</p>
<p>As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly 
into my hands.&nbsp; Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy 
and never heard him cry, was contented, as far as regarded 
him.&nbsp; For himself, he grew desperate: his sorrow was of that
kind that will not lament.&nbsp; He neither wept nor prayed; he 
cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave himself up to 
reckless dissipation.&nbsp; The servants could not bear his 
tyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two 
that would stay.&nbsp; I had not the heart to leave my charge; 
and besides, you know, I had been his foster-sister, and excused 
his behaviour more readily than a stranger would.&nbsp; Joseph 
remained to hector over tenants and labourers; and because it was
his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to 
reprove.</p>
<p>The master&rsquo;s bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty
example for Catherine and Heathcliff.&nbsp; His treatment of the 
latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint.&nbsp; And, truly, 
it appeared as if the lad <i>were</i> possessed of something 
diabolical at that period.&nbsp; He delighted to witness Hindley 
degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more notable 
for savage sullenness and ferocity.&nbsp; I could not half tell 
what an infernal house we had.&nbsp; The curate dropped calling, 
and nobody decent came near us, at last; unless Edgar 
Linton&rsquo;s visits to Miss Cathy might be an exception.&nbsp; 
At fifteen she was the queen of the country-side; she had no 
peer; and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature!&nbsp; 
I own I did not like her, after infancy was past; and I vexed her
frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she never took 
an aversion to me, though.&nbsp; She had a wondrous constancy to 
old attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections 
unalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it
difficult to make an equally deep impression.&nbsp; He was my 
late master: that is his portrait over the fireplace.&nbsp; It 
used to hang on one side, and his wife&rsquo;s on the other; but 
hers has been removed, or else you might see something of what 
she was.&nbsp; Can you make that out?</p>
<p>Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured 
face, exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but 
more pensive and amiable in expression.&nbsp; It formed a sweet 
picture.&nbsp; The long light hair curled slightly on the 
temples; the eyes were large and serious; the figure almost too 
graceful.&nbsp; I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw could 
forget her first friend for such an individual.&nbsp; I marvelled
much how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could 
fancy my idea of Catherine Earnshaw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very agreeable portrait,&rsquo; I observed to the 
house-keeper.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it like?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;but he looked better 
when he was animated; that is his everyday countenance: he wanted
spirit in general.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since 
her five-weeks&rsquo; residence among them; and as she had no 
temptation to show her rough side in their company, and had the 
sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such 
invariable courtesy, she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and 
gentleman by her ingenious cordiality; gained the admiration of 
Isabella, and the heart and soul of her brother: acquisitions 
that flattered her from the first&mdash;for she was full of 
ambition&mdash;and led her to adopt a double character without 
exactly intending to deceive any one.&nbsp; In the place where 
she heard Heathcliff termed a &lsquo;vulgar young ruffian,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;worse than a brute,&rsquo; she took care not to act 
like him; but at home she had small inclination to practise 
politeness that would only be laughed at, and restrain an unruly 
nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise.</p>
<p>Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights 
openly.&nbsp; He had a terror of Earnshaw&rsquo;s reputation, and
shrunk from encountering him; and yet he was always received with
our best attempts at civility: the master himself avoided 
offending him, knowing why he came; and if he could not be 
gracious, kept out of the way.&nbsp; I rather think his 
appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not 
artful, never played the coquette, and had evidently an objection
to her two friends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed 
contempt of Linton in his presence, she could not half coincide, 
as she did in his absence; and when Linton evinced disgust and 
antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared not treat his sentiments with 
indifference, as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely
any consequence to her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had many a laugh at her 
perplexities and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide
from my mockery.&nbsp; That sounds ill-natured: but she was so 
proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses, till 
she should be chastened into more humility.&nbsp; She did bring 
herself, finally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not
a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser.</p>
<p>Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff 
presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it.&nbsp; 
He had reached the age of sixteen then, I think, and without 
having bad features, or being deficient in intellect, he 
contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward 
repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.&nbsp;
In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his 
early education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded 
late, had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit
of knowledge, and any love for books or learning.&nbsp; His 
childhood&rsquo;s sense of superiority, instilled into him by the
favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away.&nbsp; He struggled 
long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies, and 
yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he yielded 
completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in 
the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, 
sink beneath his former level.&nbsp; Then personal appearance 
sympathised with mental deterioration: he acquired a slouching 
gait and ignoble look; his naturally reserved disposition was 
exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable 
moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting 
the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance.</p>
<p>Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons
of respite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness
for her in words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her 
girlish caresses, as if conscious there could be no gratification
in lavishing such marks of affection on him.&nbsp; On the 
before-named occasion he came into the house to announce his 
intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy to 
arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it into his
head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place to 
herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her 
brother&rsquo;s absence, and was then preparing to receive 
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?&rsquo; asked 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you going anywhere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it is raining,&rsquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why have you that silk frock on, then?&rsquo; he 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nobody coming here, I hope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that I know of,&rsquo; stammered Miss: &lsquo;but 
you should be in the field now, Heathcliff.&nbsp; It is an hour 
past dinnertime: I thought you were gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hindley does not often free us from his accursed 
presence,&rsquo; observed the boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not 
work any more to-day: I&rsquo;ll stay with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but Joseph will tell,&rsquo; she suggested; 
&lsquo;you&rsquo;d better go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone
Crags; it will take him till dark, and he&rsquo;ll never 
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down.&nbsp; 
Catherine reflected an instant, with knitted brows&mdash;she 
found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this 
afternoon,&rsquo; she said, at the conclusion of a minute&rsquo;s
silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;As it rains, I hardly expect them; but they
may come, and if they do, you run the risk of being scolded for 
no good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,&rsquo; he 
persisted; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t turn me out for those pitiful, 
silly friends of yours!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m on the point, sometimes, 
of complaining that they&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll 
not&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That they what?&rsquo; cried Catherine, gazing at him 
with a troubled countenance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Nelly!&rsquo; she 
added petulantly, jerking her head away from my hands, 
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ve combed my hair quite out of curl!&nbsp; 
That&rsquo;s enough; let me alone.&nbsp; What are you on the 
point of complaining about, Heathcliff?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing&mdash;only look at the almanack on that 
wall;&rsquo; he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the 
window, and continued, &lsquo;The crosses are for the evenings 
you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with 
me.&nbsp; Do you see?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve marked every 
day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;very foolish: as if I took notice!&rsquo; 
replied Catherine, in a peevish tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;And where is 
the sense of that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To show that I <i>do</i> take notice,&rsquo; said 
Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And should I always be sitting with you?&rsquo; she 
demanded, growing more irritated.&nbsp; &lsquo;What good do I 
get?&nbsp; What do you talk about?&nbsp; You might be dumb, or a 
baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you do, 
either!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You never told me before that I talked too little, or 
that you disliked my company, Cathy!&rsquo; exclaimed Heathcliff,
in much agitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no company at all, when people know nothing 
and say nothing,&rsquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>Her companion rose up, but he hadn&rsquo;t time to express his
feelings further, for a horse&rsquo;s feet were heard on the 
flags, and having knocked gently, young Linton entered, his face 
brilliant with delight at the unexpected summon she had 
received.&nbsp; Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between
her friends, as one came in and the other went out.&nbsp; The 
contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, 
coal country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and 
greeting were as opposite as his aspect.&nbsp; He had a sweet, 
low manner of speaking, and pronounced his words as you do: 
that&rsquo;s less gruff than we talk here, and softer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not come too soon, am I?&rsquo; he said, 
casting a look at me: I had begun to wipe the plate, and tidy 
some drawers at the far end in the dresser.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are 
you doing there, Nelly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My work, Miss,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; (Mr. Hindley had
given me directions to make a third party in any private visits 
Linton chose to pay.)</p>
<p>She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, &lsquo;Take 
yourself and your dusters off; when company are in the house, 
servants don&rsquo;t commence scouring and cleaning in the room 
where they are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a good opportunity, now that master is 
away,&rsquo; I answered aloud: &lsquo;he hates me to be fidgeting
over these things in his presence.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Edgar
will excuse me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate you to be fidgeting in <i>my</i> 
presence,&rsquo; exclaimed the young lady imperiously, not 
allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to recover her 
equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for it, Miss Catherine,&rsquo; was my 
response; and I proceeded assiduously with my occupation.</p>
<p>She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth 
from my hand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very 
spitefully on the arm.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve said I did not love her, 
and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then: besides, 
she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees, and 
screamed out, &lsquo;Oh, Miss, that&rsquo;s a nasty trick!&nbsp; 
You have no right to nip me, and I&rsquo;m not going to bear 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t touch you, you lying creature!&rsquo; 
cried she, her fingers tingling to repeat the act, and her ears 
red with rage.&nbsp; She never had power to conceal her passion, 
it always set her whole complexion in a blaze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that, then?&rsquo; I retorted, showing a 
decided purple witness to refute her.</p>
<p>She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly
impelled by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the 
cheek: a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine, love!&nbsp; Catherine!&rsquo; interposed 
Linton, greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and 
violence which his idol had committed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave the room, Ellen!&rsquo; she repeated, trembling 
all over.</p>
<p>Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting 
near me on the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying 
himself, and sobbed out complaints against &lsquo;wicked aunt 
Cathy,&rsquo; which drew her fury on to his unlucky head: she 
seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor child waxed 
livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver 
him.&nbsp; In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished 
young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could 
not be mistaken for jest.&nbsp; He drew back in 
consternation.&nbsp; I lifted Hareton in my arms, and walked off 
to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of communication open, 
for I was curious to watch how they would settle their 
disagreement.&nbsp; The insulted visitor moved to the spot where 
he had laid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; I said to myself.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Take warning and begone!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a kindness to 
let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; demanded Catherine, 
advancing to the door.</p>
<p>He swerved aside, and attempted to pass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not go!&rsquo; she exclaimed, 
energetically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must and shall!&rsquo; he replied in a subdued 
voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she persisted, grasping the handle; 
&lsquo;not yet, Edgar Linton: sit down; you shall not leave me in
that temper.&nbsp; I should be miserable all night, and I 
won&rsquo;t be miserable for you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can I stay after you have struck me?&rsquo; asked 
Linton.</p>
<p>Catherine was mute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve made me afraid and ashamed of you,&rsquo; 
he continued; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not come here again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you told a deliberate untruth!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she cried, recovering her 
speech; &lsquo;I did nothing deliberately.&nbsp; Well, go, if you
please&mdash;get away!&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ll 
cry&mdash;I&rsquo;ll cry myself sick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping 
in serious earnest.&nbsp; Edgar persevered in his resolution as 
far as the court; there he lingered.&nbsp; I resolved to 
encourage him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,&rsquo; I called 
out.&nbsp; &lsquo;As bad as any marred child: you&rsquo;d better 
be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to grieve 
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed
the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave
a mouse half killed, or a bird half eaten.&nbsp; Ah, I thought, 
there will be no saving him: he&rsquo;s doomed, and flies to his 
fate!&nbsp; And so it was: he turned abruptly, hastened into the 
house again, shut the door behind him; and when I went in a while
after to inform them that Earnshaw had come home rabid drunk, 
ready to pull the whole place about our ears (his ordinary frame 
of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had merely effected
a closer intimacy&mdash;had broken the outworks of youthful 
timidity, and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship,
and confess themselves lovers.</p>
<p>Intelligence of Mr. Hindley&rsquo;s arrival drove Linton 
speedily to his horse, and Catherine to her chamber.&nbsp; I went
to hide little Hareton, and to take the shot out of the 
master&rsquo;s fowling-piece, which he was fond of playing with 
in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who 
provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit 
upon the plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if 
he did go the length of firing the gun.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>He entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me
in the act of stowing his son sway in the kitchen cupboard.&nbsp;
Hareton was impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering 
either his wild beast&rsquo;s fondness or his madman&rsquo;s 
rage; for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to 
death, and in the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed 
against the wall; and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet 
wherever I chose to put him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, I&rsquo;ve found it out at last!&rsquo; cried 
Hindley, pulling me back by the skin of my neck, like a 
dog.&nbsp; &lsquo;By heaven and hell, you&rsquo;ve sworn between 
you to murder that child!&nbsp; I know how it is, now, that he is
always out of my way.&nbsp; But, with the help of Satan, I shall 
make you swallow the carving-knife, Nelly!&nbsp; You 
needn&rsquo;t laugh; for I&rsquo;ve just crammed Kenneth, 
head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is the same as 
one&mdash;and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest 
till I do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t like the carving-knife, Mr. 
Hindley,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;it has been cutting red 
herrings.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather be shot, if you 
please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d rather be damned!&rsquo; he said; 
&lsquo;and so you shall.&nbsp; No law in England can hinder a man
from keeping his house decent, and mine&rsquo;s abominable!&nbsp;
Open your mouth.&rsquo;&nbsp; He held the knife in his hand, and 
pushed its point between my teeth: but, for my part, I was never 
much afraid of his vagaries.&nbsp; I spat out, and affirmed it 
tasted detestably&mdash;I would not take it on any account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said he, releasing me, &lsquo;I see that 
hideous little villain is not Hareton: I beg your pardon, 
Nell.&nbsp; If it be, he deserves flaying alive for not running 
to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.&nbsp; 
Unnatural cub, come hither!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll teach thee to impose
on a good-hearted, deluded father.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t you 
think the lad would be handsomer cropped?&nbsp; It makes a dog 
fiercer, and I love something fierce&mdash;get me a 
scissors&mdash;something fierce and trim!&nbsp; Besides, 
it&rsquo;s infernal affectation&mdash;devilish conceit it is, to 
cherish our ears&mdash;we&rsquo;re asses enough without 
them.&nbsp; Hush, child, hush!&nbsp; Well then, it is my darling!
wisht, dry thy eyes&mdash;there&rsquo;s a joy; kiss me.&nbsp; 
What! it won&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Kiss me, Hareton!&nbsp; Damn thee, 
kiss me!&nbsp; By God, as if I would rear such a monster!&nbsp; 
As sure as I&rsquo;m living, I&rsquo;ll break the brat&rsquo;s 
neck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father&rsquo;s 
arms with all his might, and redoubled his yells when he carried 
him up-stairs and lifted him over the banister.&nbsp; I cried out
that he would frighten the child into fits, and ran to rescue 
him.&nbsp; As I reached them, Hindley leant forward on the rails 
to listen to a noise below; almost forgetting what he had in his 
hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who is that?&rsquo; he asked, hearing some 
one approaching the stairs&rsquo;-foot.&nbsp; I leant forward 
also, for the purpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I 
recognised, not to come further; and, at the instant when my eye 
quitted Hareton, he gave a sudden spring, delivered himself from 
the careless grasp that held him, and fell.</p>
<p>There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror 
before we saw that the little wretch was safe.&nbsp; Heathcliff 
arrived underneath just at the critical moment; by a natural 
impulse he arrested his descent, and setting him on his feet, 
looked up to discover the author of the accident.&nbsp; A miser 
who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five shillings, 
and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand 
pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on 
beholding the figure of Mr. Earnshaw above.&nbsp; It expressed, 
plainer than words could do, the intensest anguish at having made
himself the instrument of thwarting his own revenge.&nbsp; Had it
been dark, I daresay he would have tried to remedy the mistake by
smashing Hareton&rsquo;s skull on the steps; but, we witnessed 
his salvation; and I was presently below with my precious charge 
pressed to my heart.&nbsp; Hindley descended more leisurely, 
sobered and abashed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is your fault, Ellen,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you 
should have kept him out of sight: you should have taken him from
me!&nbsp; Is he injured anywhere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Injured!&rsquo; I cried angrily; &lsquo;if he is not 
killed, he&rsquo;ll be an idiot!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I wonder his 
mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re worse than a heathen&mdash;treating your own flesh 
and blood in that manner!&rsquo;&nbsp; He attempted to touch the 
child, who, on finding himself with me, sobbed off his terror 
directly.&nbsp; At the first finger his father laid on him, 
however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as 
if he would go into convulsions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall not meddle with him!&rsquo; I 
continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;He hates you&mdash;they all hate 
you&mdash;that&rsquo;s the truth!&nbsp; A happy family you have; 
and a pretty state you&rsquo;re come to!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,&rsquo; laughed 
the misguided man, recovering his hardness.&nbsp; &lsquo;At 
present, convey yourself and him away.&nbsp; And hark you, 
Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing.&nbsp; 
I wouldn&rsquo;t murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the 
house on fire: but that&rsquo;s as my fancy goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the 
dresser, and poured some into a tumbler.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; I entreated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. 
Hindley, do take warning.&nbsp; Have mercy on this unfortunate 
boy, if you care nothing for yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any one will do better for him than I shall,&rsquo; he 
answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have mercy on your own soul!&rsquo; I said, 
endeavouring to snatch the glass from his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I!&nbsp; On the contrary, I shall have great 
pleasure in sending it to perdition to punish its Maker,&rsquo; 
exclaimed the blasphemer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to its hearty
damnation!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating 
his command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to 
repeat or remember.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity he cannot kill himself with 
drink,&rsquo; observed Heathcliff, muttering an echo of curses 
back when the door was shut.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s doing his 
very utmost; but his constitution defies him.&nbsp; Mr. Kenneth 
says he would wager his mare that he&rsquo;ll outlive any man on 
this side Gimmerton, and go to the grave a hoary sinner; unless 
some happy chance out of the common course befall him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb 
to sleep.&nbsp; Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the 
barn.&nbsp; It turned out afterwards that he only got as far as 
the other side the settle, when he flung himself on a bench by 
the wall, removed from the fire and remained silent.</p>
<p>I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that 
began,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,<br
/>
The mither beneath the mools heard that,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room,
put her head in, and whispered,&mdash;&lsquo;Are you alone, 
Nelly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss,&rsquo; I replied.</p>
<p>She entered and approached the hearth.&nbsp; I, supposing she 
was going to say something, looked up.&nbsp; The expression of 
her face seemed disturbed and anxious.&nbsp; Her lips were half 
asunder, as if she meant to speak, and she drew a breath; but it 
escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence.&nbsp; I resumed my song;
not having forgotten her recent behaviour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Heathcliff?&rsquo; she said, interrupting
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About his work in the stable,&rsquo; was my answer.</p>
<p>He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a 
doze.&nbsp; There followed another long pause, during which I 
perceived a drop or two trickle from Catherine&rsquo;s cheek to 
the flags.&nbsp; Is she sorry for her shameful conduct?&mdash;I 
asked myself.&nbsp; That will be a novelty: but she may come to 
the point&mdash;as she will&mdash;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t help 
her!&nbsp; No, she felt small trouble regarding any subject, save
her own concerns.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; she cried at last.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m very unhappy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A pity,&rsquo; observed I.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re 
hard to please; so many friends and so few cares, and can&rsquo;t
make yourself content!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?&rsquo; she 
pursued, kneeling down by me, and lifting her winsome eyes to my 
face with that sort of look which turns off bad temper, even when
one has all the right in the world to indulge it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it worth keeping?&rsquo; I inquired, less 
sulkily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out!&nbsp; I 
want to know what I should do.&nbsp; To-day, Edgar Linton has 
asked me to marry him, and I&rsquo;ve given him an answer.&nbsp; 
Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or denial, you 
tell me which it ought to have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?&rsquo; I 
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;To be sure, considering the exhibition you 
performed in his presence this afternoon, I might say it would be
wise to refuse him: since he asked you after that, he must either
be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you talk so, I won&rsquo;t tell you any more,&rsquo;
she returned, peevishly rising to her feet.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
accepted him, Nelly.&nbsp; Be quick, and say whether I was 
wrong!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You accepted him!&nbsp; Then what good is it discussing
the matter?&nbsp; You have pledged your word, and cannot 
retract.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But say whether I should have done so&mdash;do!&rsquo; 
she exclaimed in an irritated tone; chafing her hands together, 
and frowning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are many things to be considered before that 
question can be answered properly,&rsquo; I said, 
sententiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;First and foremost, do you love Mr. 
Edgar?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who can help it?&nbsp; Of course I do,&rsquo; she 
answered.</p>
<p>Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of 
twenty-two it was not injudicious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, I do&mdash;that&rsquo;s 
sufficient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By no means; you must say why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be 
with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bad!&rsquo; was my commentary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And because he is young and cheerful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bad, still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And because he loves me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indifferent, coming there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the 
greatest woman of the neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of 
having such a husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worst of all.&nbsp; And now, say how you love 
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As everybody loves&mdash;You&rsquo;re silly, 
Nelly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all&mdash;Answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his 
head, and everything he touches, and every word he says.&nbsp; I 
love all his looks, and all his actions, and him entirely and 
altogether.&nbsp; There now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly 
ill-natured!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no jest to me!&rsquo; said the 
young lady, scowling, and turning her face to the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,&rsquo;
I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;You love Mr. Edgar because he is 
handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and loves you.&nbsp;
The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him without 
that, probably; and with it you wouldn&rsquo;t, unless he 
possessed the four former attractions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, to be sure not: I should only pity him&mdash;hate 
him, perhaps, if he were ugly, and a clown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there are several other handsome, rich young men in
the world: handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is.&nbsp; What
should hinder you from loving them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there be any, they are out of my way: I&rsquo;ve 
seen none like Edgar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may see some; and he won&rsquo;t always be 
handsome, and young, and may not always be rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is now; and I have only to do with the 
present.&nbsp; I wish you would speak rationally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the 
present, marry Mr. Linton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want your permission for that&mdash;I 
<i>shall</i> marry him: and yet you have not told me whether 
I&rsquo;m right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for 
the present.&nbsp; And now, let us hear what you are unhappy 
about.&nbsp; Your brother will be pleased; the old lady and 
gentleman will not object, I think; you will escape from a 
disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable one; and
you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you.&nbsp; All seems smooth and 
easy: where is the obstacle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Here</i>! and <i>here</i>!&rsquo; replied Catherine,
striking one hand on her forehead, and the other on her breast: 
&lsquo;in whichever place the soul lives.&nbsp; In my soul and in
my heart, I&rsquo;m convinced I&rsquo;m wrong!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s very strange!&nbsp; I cannot make it 
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s my secret.&nbsp; But if you will not mock at
me, I&rsquo;ll explain it: I can&rsquo;t do it distinctly; but 
I&rsquo;ll give you a feeling of how I feel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder 
and graver, and her clasped hands trembled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?&rsquo; she 
said, suddenly, after some minutes&rsquo; reflection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, now and then,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so do I.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve dreamt in my life dreams 
that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas: 
they&rsquo;ve gone through and through me, like wine through 
water, and altered the colour of my mind.&nbsp; And this is one: 
I&rsquo;m going to tell it&mdash;but take care not to smile at 
any part of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t, Miss Catherine!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;We&rsquo;re dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and 
visions to perplex us.&nbsp; Come, come, be merry and like 
yourself!&nbsp; Look at little Hareton! <i>he&rsquo;s</i> 
dreaming nothing dreary.&nbsp; How sweetly he smiles in his 
sleep!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his 
solitude!&nbsp; You remember him, I daresay, when he was just 
such another as that chubby thing: nearly as young and 
innocent.&nbsp; However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to listen: 
it&rsquo;s not long; and I&rsquo;ve no power to be merry 
to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t hear it, I won&rsquo;t hear it!&rsquo; I 
repeated, hastily.</p>
<p>I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and 
Catherine had an unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread 
something from which I might shape a prophecy, and foresee a 
fearful catastrophe.&nbsp; She was vexed, but she did not 
proceed.&nbsp; Apparently taking up another subject, she 
recommenced in a short time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely 
miserable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you are not fit to go there,&rsquo; I 
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;All sinners would be miserable in 
heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is not for that.&nbsp; I dreamt once that I was 
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you I won&rsquo;t hearken to your dreams, Miss 
Catherine!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go to bed,&rsquo; I interrupted 
again.</p>
<p>She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my
chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is nothing,&rsquo; cried she: &lsquo;I was only 
going to say that heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke 
my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were 
so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on 
the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.&nbsp;
That will do to explain my secret, as well as the other.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ve no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to 
be in heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought 
Heathcliff so low, I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought of it.&nbsp; It
would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know 
how I love him: and that, not because he&rsquo;s handsome, Nelly,
but because he&rsquo;s more myself than I am.&nbsp; Whatever our 
souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton&rsquo;s 
is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from 
fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff&rsquo;s 
presence.&nbsp; Having noticed a slight movement, I turned my 
head, and saw him rise from the bench, and steal out 
noiselessly.&nbsp; He had listened till he heard Catherine say it
would degrade her to marry him, and then he stayed to hear no 
further.&nbsp; My companion, sitting on the ground, was prevented
by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or 
departure; but I started, and bade her hush!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; she asked, gazing nervously round.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joseph is here,&rsquo; I answered, catching opportunely
the roll of his cartwheels up the road; &lsquo;and Heathcliff 
will come in with him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure whether he were 
not at the door this moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, he couldn&rsquo;t overhear me at the door!&rsquo; 
said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give me Hareton, while you get the supper,
and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.&nbsp; I want to 
cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that 
Heathcliff has no notion of these things.&nbsp; He has not, has 
he?&nbsp; He does not know what being in love is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see no reason that he should not know, as well as 
you,&rsquo; I returned; &lsquo;and if you are his choice, 
he&rsquo;ll be the most unfortunate creature that ever was 
born!&nbsp; As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend, 
and love, and all!&nbsp; Have you considered how you&rsquo;ll 
bear the separation, and how he&rsquo;ll bear to be quite 
deserted in the world?&nbsp; Because, Miss 
Catherine&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He quite deserted! we separated!&rsquo; she exclaimed, 
with an accent of indignation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who is to separate 
us, pray?&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll meet the fate of Milo!&nbsp; Not as
long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature.&nbsp; Every Linton
on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could 
consent to forsake Heathcliff.&nbsp; Oh, that&rsquo;s not what I 
intend&mdash;that&rsquo;s not what I mean!&nbsp; I 
shouldn&rsquo;t be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;ll be as much to me as he has been all his 
lifetime.&nbsp; Edgar must shake off his antipathy, and tolerate 
him, at least.&nbsp; He will, when he learns my true feelings 
towards him.&nbsp; Nelly, I see now you think me a selfish 
wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I 
married, we should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can 
aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother&rsquo;s 
power.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With your husband&rsquo;s money, Miss Catherine?&rsquo;
I asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find him not so pliable as you
calculate upon: and, though I&rsquo;m hardly a judge, I think 
that&rsquo;s the worst motive you&rsquo;ve given yet for being 
the wife of young Linton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not,&rsquo; retorted she; &lsquo;it is the 
best!&nbsp; The others were the satisfaction of my whims: and for
Edgar&rsquo;s sake, too, to satisfy him.&nbsp; This is for the 
sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to Edgar 
and myself.&nbsp; I cannot express it; but surely you and 
everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence 
of yours beyond you.&nbsp; What were the use of my creation, if I
were entirely contained here?&nbsp; My great miseries in this 
world have been Heathcliff&rsquo;s miseries, and I watched and 
felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is 
himself.&nbsp; If all else perished, and <i>he</i> remained, 
<i>I</i> should still continue to be; and if all else remained, 
and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty 
stranger: I should not seem a part of it.&mdash;My love for 
Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, 
I&rsquo;m well aware, as winter changes the trees.&nbsp; My love 
for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of 
little visible delight, but necessary.&nbsp; Nelly, I <i>am</i> 
Heathcliff!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s always, always in my mind: not as a 
pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as 
my own being.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t talk of our separation again: 
it is impracticable; and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I 
jerked it forcibly away.&nbsp; I was out of patience with her 
folly!</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,&rsquo; 
I said, &lsquo;it only goes to convince me that you are ignorant 
of the duties you undertake in marrying; or else that you are a 
wicked, unprincipled girl.&nbsp; But trouble me with no more 
secrets: I&rsquo;ll not promise to keep them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll keep that?&rsquo; she asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll not promise,&rsquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished 
our conversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and
nursed Hareton, while I made the supper.&nbsp; After it was 
cooked, my fellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry
some to Mr. Hindley; and we didn&rsquo;t settle it till all was 
nearly cold.&nbsp; Then we came to the agreement that we would 
let him ask, if he wanted any; for we feared particularly to go 
into his presence when he had been some time alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how isn&rsquo;t that nowt comed in fro&rsquo; 
th&rsquo; field, be this time?&nbsp; What is he about? girt idle 
seeght!&rsquo; demanded the old man, looking round for 
Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll call him,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s in the barn, I&rsquo;ve no doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I went and called, but got no answer.&nbsp; On returning, I 
whispered to Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she 
said, I was sure; and told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as
she complained of her brother&rsquo;s conduct regarding 
him.&nbsp; She jumped up in a fine fright, flung Hareton on to 
the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not taking 
leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk 
would have affected him.&nbsp; She was absent such a while that 
Joseph proposed we should wait no longer.&nbsp; He cunningly 
conjectured they were staying away in order to avoid hearing his 
protracted blessing.&nbsp; They were &lsquo;ill eneugh for ony 
fahl manners,&rsquo; he affirmed.&nbsp; And on their behalf he 
added that night a special prayer to the usual 
quarter-of-an-hour&rsquo;s supplication before meat, and would 
have tacked another to the end of the grace, had not his young 
mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he must 
run down the road, and, wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and
make him re-enter directly!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to speak to him, and I <i>must</i>, before I go 
upstairs,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the gate is open: he 
is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not reply, though I 
shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, 
however, to suffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat 
on his head, and walked grumbling forth.&nbsp; Meantime, 
Catherine paced up and down the floor, exclaiming&mdash;&lsquo;I 
wonder where he is&mdash;I wonder where he can be!&nbsp; What did
I say, Nelly?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve forgotten.&nbsp; Was he vexed at 
my bad humour this afternoon?&nbsp; Dear! tell me what I&rsquo;ve
said to grieve him?&nbsp; I do wish he&rsquo;d come.&nbsp; I do 
wish he would!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a noise for nothing!&rsquo; I cried, though rather
uneasy myself.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a trifle scares you!&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff should 
take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to 
speak to us in the hay-loft.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll engage he&rsquo;s 
lurking there.&nbsp; See if I don&rsquo;t ferret him 
out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, 
and Joseph&rsquo;s quest ended in the same.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yon lad gets war und war!&rsquo; observed he on 
re-entering.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s left th&rsquo; gate at 
t&rsquo; full swing, and Miss&rsquo;s pony has trodden dahn two 
rigs o&rsquo; corn, and plottered through, raight o&rsquo;er into
t&rsquo; meadow!&nbsp; Hahsomdiver, t&rsquo; maister &lsquo;ull 
play t&rsquo; devil to-morn, and he&rsquo;ll do weel.&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;s patience itsseln wi&rsquo; sich careless, offald 
craters&mdash;patience itsseln he is!&nbsp; Bud he&rsquo;ll not 
be soa allus&mdash;yah&rsquo;s see, all on ye!&nbsp; Yah 
mun&rsquo;n&rsquo;t drive him out of his heead for 
nowt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?&rsquo; interrupted 
Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you been looking for him, as I 
ordered?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I sud more likker look for th&rsquo; horse,&rsquo; he 
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;It &rsquo;ud be to more sense.&nbsp; Bud I 
can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike 
this&mdash;as black as t&rsquo; chimbley! und Heathcliff&rsquo;s 
noan t&rsquo; chap to coom at <i>my</i> whistle&mdash;happen 
he&rsquo;ll be less hard o&rsquo; hearing wi&rsquo; 
<i>ye</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> a very dark evening for summer: the clouds 
appeared inclined to thunder, and I said we had better all sit 
down; the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home 
without further trouble.&nbsp; However, Catherine would not be 
persuaded into tranquillity.&nbsp; She kept wandering to and fro,
from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which 
permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation 
on one side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my 
expostulations and the growling thunder, and the great drops that
began to plash around her, she remained, calling at intervals, 
and then listening, and then crying outright.&nbsp; She beat 
Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of crying.</p>
<p>About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling
over the Heights in full fury.&nbsp; There was a violent wind, as
well as thunder, and either one or the other split a tree off at 
the corner of the building: a huge bough fell across the roof, 
and knocked down a portion of the east chimney-stack, sending a 
clatter of stones and soot into the kitchen-fire.&nbsp; We 
thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and Joseph swung 
on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the patriarchs 
Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous, 
though he smote the ungodly.&nbsp; I felt some sentiment that it 
must be a judgment on us also.&nbsp; The Jonah, in my mind, was 
Mr. Earnshaw; and I shook the handle of his den that I might 
ascertain if he were yet living.&nbsp; He replied audibly enough,
in a fashion which made my companion vociferate, more clamorously
than before, that a wide distinction might be drawn between 
saints like himself and sinners like his master.&nbsp; But the 
uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed; 
excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in
refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawl-less 
to catch as much water as she could with her hair and 
clothes.&nbsp; She came in and lay down on the settle, all soaked
as she was, turning her face to the back, and putting her hands 
before it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Miss!&rsquo; I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; 
&lsquo;you are not bent on getting your death, are you?&nbsp; Do 
you know what o&rsquo;clock it is?&nbsp; Half-past twelve.&nbsp; 
Come, come to bed! there&rsquo;s no use waiting any longer on 
that foolish boy: he&rsquo;ll be gone to Gimmerton, and 
he&rsquo;ll stay there now.&nbsp; He guesses we shouldn&rsquo;t 
wait for him till this late hour: at least, he guesses that only 
Mr. Hindley would be up; and he&rsquo;d rather avoid having the 
door opened by the master.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, nay, he&rsquo;s noan at Gimmerton,&rsquo; said 
Joseph.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;s niver wonder but he&rsquo;s at 
t&rsquo; bothom of a bog-hoile.&nbsp; This visitation 
worn&rsquo;t for nowt, and I wod hev&rsquo; ye to look out, 
Miss&mdash;yah muh be t&rsquo; next.&nbsp; Thank Hivin for 
all!&nbsp; All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, 
and piked out fro&rsquo; th&rsquo; rubbidge!&nbsp; Yah knaw whet 
t&rsquo; Scripture ses.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he began quoting several
texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we might find 
them.</p>
<p>I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her
wet things, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook 
myself to bed with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if 
everyone had been sleeping round him.&nbsp; I heard Joseph read 
on a while afterwards; then I distinguished his slow step on the 
ladder, and then I dropped asleep.</p>
<p>Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams 
piercing the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated 
near the fireplace.&nbsp; The house-door was ajar, too; light 
entered from its unclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and 
stood on the kitchen hearth, haggard and drowsy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What ails you, Cathy?&rsquo; he was saying when I 
entered: &lsquo;you look as dismal as a drowned whelp.&nbsp; Why 
are you so damp and pale, child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been wet,&rsquo; she answered reluctantly, 
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;m cold, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, she is naughty!&rsquo; I cried, perceiving the 
master to be tolerably sober.&nbsp; &lsquo;She got steeped in the
shower of yesterday evening, and there she has sat the night 
through, and I couldn&rsquo;t prevail on her to stir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;The night 
through,&rsquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;What kept her up? not 
fear of the thunder, surely?&nbsp; That was over hours 
since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff&rsquo;s absence, as
long as we could conceal it; so I replied, I didn&rsquo;t know 
how she took it into her head to sit up; and she said 
nothing.&nbsp; The morning was fresh and cool; I threw back the 
lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents from the
garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, &lsquo;Ellen, shut 
the window.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m starving!&rsquo;&nbsp; And her teeth 
chattered as she shrank closer to the almost extinguished 
embers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s ill,&rsquo; said Hindley, taking her wrist;
&lsquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s the reason she would not go to 
bed.&nbsp; Damn it!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to be troubled with 
more sickness here.&nbsp; What took you into the rain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Running after t&rsquo; lads, as usuald!&rsquo; croaked 
Joseph, catching an opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in 
his evil tongue.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I war yah, maister, I&rsquo;d 
just slam t&rsquo; boards i&rsquo; their faces all on &rsquo;em, 
gentle and simple!&nbsp; Never a day ut yah&rsquo;re off, but yon
cat o&rsquo; Linton comes sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, 
shoo&rsquo;s a fine lass! shoo sits watching for ye i&rsquo; 
t&rsquo; kitchen; and as yah&rsquo;re in at one door, he&rsquo;s 
out at t&rsquo;other; and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting 
of her side!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s bonny behaviour, lurking amang 
t&rsquo; fields, after twelve o&rsquo; t&rsquo; night, wi&rsquo; 
that fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff!&nbsp; They 
think <i>I&rsquo;m</i> blind; but I&rsquo;m noan: nowt ut 
t&rsquo; soart!&mdash;I seed young Linton boath coming and going,
and I seed <i>yah</i>&rsquo; (directing his discourse to me), 
&lsquo;yah gooid fur nowt, slattenly witch! nip up and bolt into 
th&rsquo; house, t&rsquo; minute yah heard t&rsquo; 
maister&rsquo;s horse-fit clatter up t&rsquo; road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence, eavesdropper!&rsquo; cried Catherine; 
&lsquo;none of your insolence before me!&nbsp; Edgar Linton came 
yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was <i>I</i> who told him to
be off: because I knew you would not like to have met him as you 
were.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You lie, Cathy, no doubt,&rsquo; answered her brother, 
&lsquo;and you are a confounded simpleton!&nbsp; But never mind 
Linton at present: tell me, were you not with Heathcliff last 
night?&nbsp; Speak the truth, now.&nbsp; You need not he afraid 
of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me a 
good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender 
of breaking his neck.&nbsp; To prevent it, I shall send him about
his business this very morning; and after he&rsquo;s gone, 
I&rsquo;d advise you all to look sharp: I shall only have the 
more humour for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never saw Heathcliff last night,&rsquo; answered 
Catherine, beginning to sob bitterly: &lsquo;and if you do turn 
him out of doors, I&rsquo;ll go with him.&nbsp; But, perhaps, 
you&rsquo;ll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he&rsquo;s 
gone.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and 
the remainder of her words were inarticulate.</p>
<p>Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade 
her get to her room immediately, or she shouldn&rsquo;t cry for 
nothing!&nbsp; I obliged her to obey; and I shall never forget 
what a scene she acted when we reached her chamber: it terrified 
me.&nbsp; I thought she was going mad, and I begged Joseph to run
for the doctor.&nbsp; It proved the commencement of delirium: Mr.
Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her dangerously ill; 
she had a fever.&nbsp; He bled her, and he told me to let her 
live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw 
herself downstairs or out of the window; and then he left: for he
had enough to do in the parish, where two or three miles was the 
ordinary distance between cottage and cottage.</p>
<p>Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the 
master were no better, and though our patient was as wearisome 
and headstrong as a patient could be, she weathered it 
through.&nbsp; Old Mrs. Linton paid us several visits, to be 
sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and ordered us all; 
and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted on conveying 
her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were very 
grateful.&nbsp; But the poor dame had reason to repent of her 
kindness: she and her husband both took the fever, and died 
within a few days of each other.</p>
<p>Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and
haughtier than ever.&nbsp; Heathcliff had never been heard of 
since the evening of the thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the 
misfortune, when she had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the 
blame of his disappearance on her: where indeed it belonged, as 
she well knew.&nbsp; From that period, for several months, she 
ceased to hold any communication with me, save in the relation of
a mere servant.&nbsp; Joseph fell under a ban also: he would 
speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a 
little girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, 
and thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be 
treated with consideration.&nbsp; Then the doctor had said that 
she would not bear crossing much; she ought to have her own way; 
and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any one to 
presume to stand up and contradict her.&nbsp; From Mr. Earnshaw 
and his companions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and 
serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages, her 
brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand, and generally
avoided aggravating her fiery temper.&nbsp; He was rather too 
indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection, but from
pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family 
by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him alone
she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared!&nbsp; 
Edgar Linton, as multitudes have been before and will be after 
him, was infatuated: and believed himself the happiest man alive 
on the day he led her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent
to his father&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave 
Wuthering Heights and accompany her here, Little Hareton was 
nearly five years old, and I had just begun to teach him his 
letters.&nbsp; We made a sad parting; but Catherine&rsquo;s tears
were more powerful than ours.&nbsp; When I refused to go, and 
when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting
to her husband and brother.&nbsp; The former offered me 
munificent wages; the latter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no 
women in the house, he said, now that there was no mistress; and 
as to Hareton, the curate should take him in hand, 
by-and-by.&nbsp; And so I had but one choice left: to do as I was
ordered.&nbsp; I told the master he got rid of all decent people 
only to run to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said 
good-by; and since then he has been a stranger: and it&rsquo;s 
very queer to think it, but I&rsquo;ve no doubt he has completely
forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he was ever more than 
all the world to her and she to him!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>At this point of the housekeeper&rsquo;s story she chanced to 
glance towards the time-piece over the chimney; and was in 
amazement on seeing the minute-hand measure half-past one.&nbsp; 
She would not hear of staying a second longer: in truth, I felt 
rather disposed to defer the sequel of her narrative 
myself.&nbsp; And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I 
have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to
go also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>A charming introduction to a hermit&rsquo;s life!&nbsp; Four 
weeks&rsquo; torture, tossing, and sickness!&nbsp; Oh, these 
bleak winds and bitter northern skies, and impassable roads, and 
dilatory country surgeons!&nbsp; And oh, this dearth of the human
physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible intimation of 
Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till 
spring!</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call.&nbsp; About 
seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse&mdash;the last of the
season.&nbsp; Scoundrel!&nbsp; He is not altogether guiltless in 
this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind to tell 
him.&nbsp; But, alas! how could I offend a man who was charitable
enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other 
subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?&nbsp; This
is quite an easy interval.&nbsp; I am too weak to read; yet I 
feel as if I could enjoy something interesting.&nbsp; Why not 
have up Mrs. Dean to finish her tale?&nbsp; I can recollect its 
chief incidents, as far as she had gone.&nbsp; Yes: I remember 
her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years; 
and the heroine was married.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ring: she&rsquo;ll 
be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully.&nbsp; Mrs.
Dean came.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the 
medicine,&rsquo; she commenced.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Away, away with it!&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;I desire 
to have&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The doctor says you must drop the powders.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With all my heart!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t interrupt 
me.&nbsp; Come and take your seat here.&nbsp; Keep your fingers 
from that bitter phalanx of vials.&nbsp; Draw your knitting out 
of your pocket&mdash;that will do&mdash;now continue the history 
of Mr. Heathcliff, from where you left off, to the present 
day.&nbsp; Did he finish his education on the Continent, and come
back a gentleman? or did he get a sizar&rsquo;s place at college,
or escape to America, and earn honours by drawing blood from his 
foster-country? or make a fortune more promptly on the English 
highways?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. 
Lockwood; but I couldn&rsquo;t give my word for any.&nbsp; I 
stated before that I didn&rsquo;t know how he gained his money; 
neither am I aware of the means he took to raise his mind from 
the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with your 
leave, I&rsquo;ll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will
amuse and not weary you.&nbsp; Are you feeling better this 
morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s good news.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to
my agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I
dared to expect.&nbsp; She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton;
and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection.&nbsp; They
were both very attentive to her comfort, certainly.&nbsp; It was 
not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles 
embracing the thorn.&nbsp; There were no mutual concessions: one 
stood erect, and the others yielded: and who can be ill-natured 
and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition nor 
indifference?&nbsp; I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted 
fear of ruffling her humour.&nbsp; He concealed it from her; but 
if ever he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow
cloudy at some imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble
by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own 
account.&nbsp; He many a time spoke sternly to me about my 
pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict 
a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed.&nbsp; Not
to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for 
the space of half a year, the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, 
because no fire came near to explode it.&nbsp; Catherine had 
seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected 
with sympathising silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an
alteration in her constitution, produced by her perilous illness;
as she was never subject to depression of spirits before.&nbsp; 
The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from 
him.&nbsp; I believe I may assert that they were really in 
possession of deep and growing happiness.</p>
<p>It ended.&nbsp; Well, we <i>must</i> be for ourselves in the 
long run; the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than
the domineering; and it ended when circumstances caused each to 
feel that the one&rsquo;s interest was not the chief 
consideration in the other&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp; On a mellow 
evening in September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy 
basket of apples which I had been gathering.&nbsp; It had got 
dusk, and the moon looked over the high wall of the court, 
causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous 
projecting portions of the building.&nbsp; I set my burden on the
house-steps by the kitchen-door, and lingered to rest, and drew 
in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet air; my eyes were on the
moon, and my back to the entrance, when I heard a voice behind me
say,&mdash;&lsquo;Nelly, is that you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was 
something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it 
sound familiar.&nbsp; I turned about to discover who spoke, 
fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I had seen nobody on 
approaching the steps.&nbsp; Something stirred in the porch; and,
moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark 
clothes, with dark face and hair.&nbsp; He leant against the 
side, and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open 
for himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who can it be?&rsquo; I thought.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Mr. Earnshaw?&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; The voice has no 
resemblance to his.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have waited here an hour,&rsquo; he resumed, while I 
continued staring; &lsquo;and the whole of that time all round 
has been as still as death.&nbsp; I dared not enter.&nbsp; You do
not know me?&nbsp; Look, I&rsquo;m not a stranger!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half 
covered with black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes 
deep-set and singular.&nbsp; I remembered the eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; I cried, uncertain whether to regard him 
as a worldly visitor, and I raised my hands in amazement.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What! you come back?&nbsp; Is it really you?&nbsp; Is 
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Heathcliff,&rsquo; he replied, glancing from me up
to the windows, which reflected a score of glittering moons, but 
showed no lights from within.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are they at home? 
where is she?&nbsp; Nelly, you are not glad! you needn&rsquo;t be
so disturbed.&nbsp; Is she here?&nbsp; Speak!&nbsp; I want to 
have one word with her&mdash;your mistress.&nbsp; Go, and say 
some person from Gimmerton desires to see her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How will she take it?&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What will she do?&nbsp; The surprise bewilders me&mdash;it
will put her out of her head!&nbsp; And you <i>are</i> 
Heathcliff!&nbsp; But altered!&nbsp; Nay, there&rsquo;s no 
comprehending it.&nbsp; Have you been for a soldier?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go and carry my message,&rsquo; he interrupted, 
impatiently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in hell till you 
do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the 
parlour where Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade 
myself to proceed.&nbsp; At length I resolved on making an excuse
to ask if they would have the candles lighted, and I opened the 
door.</p>
<p>They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against 
the wall, and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild 
green park, the valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist 
winding nearly to its top (for very soon after you pass the 
chapel, as you may have noticed, the sough that runs from the 
marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen).&nbsp; 
Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old 
house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side.&nbsp;
Both the room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, 
looked wondrously peaceful.&nbsp; I shrank reluctantly from 
performing my errand; and was actually going away leaving it 
unsaid, after having put my question about the candles, when a 
sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter, &lsquo;A 
person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does he want?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Linton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not question him,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, close the curtains, Nelly,&rsquo; she said; 
&lsquo;and bring up tea.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be back again 
directly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who
it was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some one mistress does not expect,&rsquo; I 
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;That Heathcliff&mdash;you recollect him, 
sir&mdash;who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! the gipsy&mdash;the ploughboy?&rsquo; he 
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why did you not say so to 
Catherine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush! you must not call him by those names, 
master,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;d be sadly grieved 
to hear you.&nbsp; She was nearly heartbroken when he ran 
off.&nbsp; I guess his return will make a jubilee to 
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room 
that overlooked the court.&nbsp; He unfastened it, and leant 
out.&nbsp; I suppose they were below, for he exclaimed quickly: 
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stand there, love!&nbsp; Bring the person in, 
if it be anyone particular.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ere long, I heard the 
click of the latch, and Catherine flew up-stairs, breathless and 
wild; too excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you 
would rather have surmised an awful calamity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Edgar, Edgar!&rsquo; she panted, flinging her arms 
round his neck.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Edgar darling!&nbsp; 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s come back&mdash;he is!&rsquo;&nbsp; And she 
tightened her embrace to a squeeze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; cried her husband, crossly, 
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t strangle me for that!&nbsp; He never struck me
as such a marvellous treasure.&nbsp; There is no need to be 
frantic!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t like him,&rsquo; she answered, 
repressing a little the intensity of her delight.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.&nbsp; Shall I 
tell him to come up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;into the 
parlour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where else?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable 
place for him.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll 
expression&mdash;half angry, half laughing at his 
fastidiousness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she added, after a while; &lsquo;I cannot 
sit in the kitchen.&nbsp; Set two tables here, Ellen: one for 
your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry; the other for 
Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.&nbsp; Will that
please you, dear?&nbsp; Or must I have a fire lighted 
elsewhere?&nbsp; If so, give directions.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll run 
down and secure my guest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid the joy is too 
great to be real!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>You</i> bid him step up,&rsquo; he said, addressing 
me; &lsquo;and, Catherine, try to be glad, without being 
absurd.&nbsp; The whole household need not witness the sight of 
your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, 
evidently anticipating an invitation to enter.&nbsp; He followed 
my guidance without waste of words, and I ushered him into the 
presence of the master and mistress, whose flushed cheeks 
betrayed signs of warm talking.&nbsp; But the lady&rsquo;s glowed
with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door: she 
sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton; and 
then she seized Linton&rsquo;s reluctant fingers and crushed them
into his.&nbsp; Now, fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, 
I was amazed, more than ever, to behold the transformation of 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; He had grown a tall, athletic, well-formed man;
beside whom my master seemed quite slender and youth-like.&nbsp; 
His upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the
army.&nbsp; His countenance was much older in expression and 
decision of feature than Mr. Linton&rsquo;s; it looked 
intelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation.&nbsp; A
half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and 
eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was 
even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though stern for 
grace.&nbsp; My master&rsquo;s surprise equalled or exceeded 
mine: he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the 
ploughboy, as he had called him.&nbsp; Heathcliff dropped his 
slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to 
speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit down, sir,&rsquo; he said, at length.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Mrs. Linton, recalling old times, would have me give you a
cordial reception; and, of course, I am gratified when anything 
occurs to please her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I also,&rsquo; answered Heathcliff, 
&lsquo;especially if it be anything in which I have a part.&nbsp;
I shall stay an hour or two willingly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on 
him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it.&nbsp;
He did not raise his to her often: a quick glance now and then 
sufficed; but it flashed back, each time more confidently, the 
undisguised delight he drank from hers.&nbsp; They were too much 
absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment.&nbsp; Not 
so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a feeling that 
reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across the 
rug, seized Heathcliff&rsquo;s hands again, and laughed like one 
beside herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall think it a dream to-morrow!&rsquo; she 
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall not be able to believe that I have 
seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.&nbsp; And yet, 
cruel Heathcliff! you don&rsquo;t deserve this welcome.&nbsp; To 
be absent and silent for three years, and never to think of 
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little more than you have thought of me,&rsquo; he 
murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;I heard of your marriage, Cathy, not long 
since; and, while waiting in the yard below, I meditated this 
plan&mdash;just to have one glimpse of your face, a stare of 
surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my 
score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution 
on myself.&nbsp; Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind;
but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time!&nbsp; 
Nay, you&rsquo;ll not drive me off again.&nbsp; You were really 
sorry for me, were you?&nbsp; Well, there was cause.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ve fought through a bitter life since I last heard your 
voice; and you must forgive me, for I struggled only for 
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to 
come to the table,&rsquo; interrupted Linton, striving to 
preserve his ordinary tone, and a due measure of 
politeness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk, 
wherever he may lodge to-night; and I&rsquo;m thirsty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, 
summoned by the bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I
left the room.&nbsp; The meal hardly endured ten minutes.&nbsp; 
Catherine&rsquo;s cup was never filled: she could neither eat nor
drink.&nbsp; Edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and scarcely 
swallowed a mouthful.&nbsp; Their guest did not protract his stay
that evening above an hour longer.&nbsp; I asked, as he departed,
if he went to Gimmerton?</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, to Wuthering Heights,&rsquo; he answered: 
&lsquo;Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when I called this 
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Earnshaw invited <i>him</i>! and <i>he</i> called on Mr. 
Earnshaw!&nbsp; I pondered this sentence painfully, after he was 
gone.&nbsp; Is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite, and coming 
into the country to work mischief under a cloak?&nbsp; I mused: I
had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better 
have remained away.</p>
<p>About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap
by Mrs. Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my 
bedside, and pulling me by the hair to rouse me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot rest, Ellen,&rsquo; she said, by way of 
apology.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I want some living creature to keep me 
company in my happiness!&nbsp; Edgar is sulky, because I&rsquo;m 
glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to open 
his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he 
affirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was 
so sick and sleepy.&nbsp; He always contrives to be sick at the 
least cross!&nbsp; I gave a few sentences of commendation to 
Heathcliff, and he, either for a headache or a pang of envy, 
began to cry: so I got up and left him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?&rsquo; I 
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;As lads they had an aversion to each 
other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him 
praised: it&rsquo;s human nature.&nbsp; Let Mr. Linton alone 
about him, unless you would like an open quarrel between 
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But does it not show great weakness?&rsquo; pursued 
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not envious: I never feel hurt at the
brightness of Isabella&rsquo;s yellow hair and the whiteness of 
her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the family
exhibit for her.&nbsp; Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute 
sometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish 
mother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good 
temper.&nbsp; It pleases her brother to see us cordial, and that 
pleases me.&nbsp; But they are very much alike: they are spoiled 
children, and fancy the world was made for their accommodation; 
and though I humour both, I think a smart chastisement might 
improve them all the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken, Mrs. Linton,&rsquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;They humour you: I know what there would be to do
if they did not.&nbsp; You can well afford to indulge their 
passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your
desires.&nbsp; You may, however, fall out, at last, over 
something of equal consequence to both sides; and then those you 
term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as 
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then we shall fight to the death, 
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we, Nelly?&rsquo; she returned, 
laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;No! I tell you, I have such faith in 
Linton&rsquo;s love, that I believe I might kill him, and he 
wouldn&rsquo;t wish to retaliate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I advised her to value him the more for his affection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;but he needn&rsquo;t 
resort to whining for trifles.&nbsp; It is childish and, instead 
of melting into tears because I said that Heathcliff was now 
worthy of anyone&rsquo;s regard, and it would honour the first 
gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said 
it for me, and been delighted from sympathy.&nbsp; He must get 
accustomed to him, and he may as well like him: considering how 
Heathcliff has reason to object to him, I&rsquo;m sure he behaved
excellently!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think of his going to Wuthering 
Heights?&rsquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is reformed in every 
respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering the right hand 
of fellowship to his enemies all around!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He explained it,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
wonder as much as you.&nbsp; He said he called to gather 
information concerning me from you, supposing you resided there 
still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to 
questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been 
living; and finally, desired him to walk in.&nbsp; There were 
some persons sitting at cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother
lost some money to him, and, finding him plentifully supplied, he
requested that he would come again in the evening: to which he 
consented.&nbsp; Hindley is too reckless to select his 
acquaintance prudently: he doesn&rsquo;t trouble himself to 
reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he 
has basely injured.&nbsp; But Heathcliff affirms his principal 
reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a
wish to instal himself in quarters at walking distance from the 
Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived together; 
and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of 
seeing him there than I could have if he settled in 
Gimmerton.&nbsp; He means to offer liberal payment for permission
to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother&rsquo;s 
covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always 
greedy; though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with 
the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a nice place for a young man to fix his 
dwelling in!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you no fear of the 
consequences, Mrs. Linton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None for my friend,&rsquo; she replied: &lsquo;his 
strong head will keep him from danger; a little for Hindley: but 
he can&rsquo;t be made morally worse than he is; and I stand 
between him and bodily harm.&nbsp; The event of this evening has 
reconciled me to God and humanity!&nbsp; I had risen in angry 
rebellion against Providence.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;ve endured very, 
very bitter misery, Nelly!&nbsp; If that creature knew how 
bitter, he&rsquo;d be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle 
petulance.&nbsp; It was kindness for him which induced me to bear
it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, he would 
have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as 
I.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s over, and I&rsquo;ll take no revenge
on his folly; I can afford to suffer anything hereafter!&nbsp; 
Should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek, I&rsquo;d 
not only turn the other, but I&rsquo;d ask pardon for provoking 
it; and, as a proof, I&rsquo;ll go make my peace with Edgar 
instantly.&nbsp; Good-night!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an angel!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the 
success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: 
Mr. Linton had not only abjured his peevishness (though his 
spirits seemed still subdued by Catherine&rsquo;s exuberance of 
vivacity), but he ventured no objection to her taking Isabella 
with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she rewarded 
him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as 
made the house a paradise for several days; both master and 
servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.</p>
<p>Heathcliff&mdash;Mr. Heathcliff I should say in 
future&mdash;used the liberty of visiting at Thrushcross Grange 
cautiously, at first: he seemed estimating how far its owner 
would bear his intrusion.&nbsp; Catherine, also, deemed it 
judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving 
him; and he gradually established his right to be expected.&nbsp;
He retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was
remarkable; and that served to repress all startling 
demonstrations of feeling.&nbsp; My master&rsquo;s uneasiness 
experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into 
another channel for a space.</p>
<p>His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated 
misfortune of Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible 
attraction towards the tolerated guest.&nbsp; She was at that 
time a charming young lady of eighteen; infantile in manners, 
though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a keen temper, 
too, if irritated.&nbsp; Her brother, who loved her tenderly, was
appalled at this fantastic preference.&nbsp; Leaving aside the 
degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible 
fact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into
such a one&rsquo;s power, he had sense to comprehend 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s disposition: to know that, though his exterior
was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged.&nbsp; And 
he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank forebodingly 
from the idea of committing Isabella to its keeping.&nbsp; He 
would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her 
attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened 
no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he discovered its 
existence he laid the blame on Heathcliff&rsquo;s deliberate 
designing.</p>
<p>We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton 
fretted and pined over something.&nbsp; She grew cross and 
wearisome; snapping at and teasing Catherine continually, at the 
imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience.&nbsp; We 
excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of ill-health: she 
was dwindling and fading before our eyes.&nbsp; But one day, when
she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast, 
complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that
the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and 
Edgar neglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors 
being left open, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to
vex her, with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs. 
Linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed; and, 
having scolded her heartily, threatened to send for the 
doctor.&nbsp; Mention of Kenneth caused her to exclaim, 
instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only 
Catherine&rsquo;s harshness which made her unhappy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you say I am harsh, you naughty 
fondling?&rsquo; cried the mistress, amazed at the unreasonable 
assertion.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are surely losing your reason.&nbsp; 
When have I been hash, tell me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yesterday,&rsquo; sobbed Isabella, &lsquo;and 
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yesterday!&rsquo; said her sister-in-law.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;On what occasion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where
I pleased, while you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that&rsquo;s your notion of harshness?&rsquo; said 
Catherine, laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was no hint that your 
company was superfluous?&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t care whether you 
kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff&rsquo;s talk 
would have nothing entertaining for your ears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; wept the young lady; &lsquo;you wished 
me away, because you knew I liked to be there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she sane?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to 
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll repeat our conversation, word for 
word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it could have had for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the conversation,&rsquo; she 
answered: &lsquo;I wanted to be with&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to
complete the sentence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With him: and I won&rsquo;t be always sent off!&rsquo; 
she continued, kindling up.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are a dog in the 
manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but 
yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are an impertinent little monkey!&rsquo; exclaimed 
Mrs. Linton, in surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll not believe
this idiotcy!&nbsp; It is impossible that you can covet the 
admiration of Heathcliff&mdash;that you consider him an agreeable
person!&nbsp; I hope I have misunderstood you, 
Isabella?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you have not,&rsquo; said the infatuated 
girl.&nbsp; &lsquo;I love him more than ever you loved Edgar, and
he might love me, if you would let him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be you for a kingdom, then!&rsquo; 
Catherine declared, emphatically: and she seemed to speak 
sincerely.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nelly, help me to convince her of her 
madness.&nbsp; Tell her what Heathcliff is: an unreclaimed 
creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid 
wilderness of furze and whinstone.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d as soon put 
that little canary into the park on a winter&rsquo;s day, as 
recommend you to bestow your heart on him!&nbsp; It is deplorable
ignorance of his character, child, and nothing else, which makes 
that dream enter your head.&nbsp; Pray, don&rsquo;t imagine that 
he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern 
exterior!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not a rough diamond&mdash;a 
pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he&rsquo;s a fierce, 
pitiless, wolfish man.&nbsp; I never say to him, &ldquo;Let this 
or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to 
harm them;&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;Let them alone, because <i>I</i> 
should hate them to be wronged:&rdquo; and he&rsquo;d crush you 
like a sparrow&rsquo;s egg, Isabella, if he found you a 
troublesome charge.&nbsp; I know he couldn&rsquo;t love a Linton;
and yet he&rsquo;d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and 
expectations: avarice is growing with him a besetting sin.&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s my picture: and I&rsquo;m his friend&mdash;so much 
so, that had he thought seriously to catch you, I should, 
perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his 
trap.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For shame! for shame!&rsquo; she repeated, 
angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are worse than twenty foes, you 
poisonous friend!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you won&rsquo;t believe me, then?&rsquo; said 
Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;You think I speak from wicked 
selfishness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m certain you do,&rsquo; retorted Isabella; 
&lsquo;and I shudder at you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; cried the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;Try for 
yourself, if that be your spirit: I have done, and yield the 
argument to your saucy insolence.&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I must suffer for her egotism!&rsquo; she sobbed, 
as Mrs. Linton left the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;All, all is against 
me: she has blighted my single consolation.&nbsp; But she uttered
falsehoods, didn&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff is not a 
fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he
remember her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,&rsquo; I 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a bird of bad omen: no mate for 
you.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can&rsquo;t 
contradict her.&nbsp; She is better acquainted with his heart 
than I, or any one besides; and she never would represent him as 
worse than he is.&nbsp; Honest people don&rsquo;t hide their 
deeds.&nbsp; How has he been living? how has he got rich? why is 
he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man whom he 
abhors?&nbsp; They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he 
came.&nbsp; They sit up all night together continually, and 
Hindley has been borrowing money on his land, and does nothing 
but play and drink: I heard only a week ago&mdash;it was Joseph 
who told me&mdash;I met him at Gimmerton: &ldquo;Nelly,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;s hae a crowner&rsquo;s &lsquo;quest enow, 
at ahr folks&rsquo;.&nbsp; One on &rsquo;em &rsquo;s a&rsquo;most
getten his finger cut off wi&rsquo; hauding t&rsquo; other 
fro&rsquo; stickin&rsquo; hisseln loike a cawlf.&nbsp; 
That&rsquo;s maister, yeah knaw, &rsquo;at &rsquo;s soa up 
o&rsquo; going tuh t&rsquo; grand &rsquo;sizes.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s 
noan feared o&rsquo; t&rsquo; bench o&rsquo; judges, norther 
Paul, nur Peter, nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on &rsquo;em, 
not he!&nbsp; He fair likes&mdash;he langs to set his brazened 
face agean &rsquo;em!&nbsp; And yon bonny lad Heathcliff, yah 
mind, he&rsquo;s a rare &rsquo;un.&nbsp; He can girn a laugh as 
well &rsquo;s onybody at a raight divil&rsquo;s jest.&nbsp; Does 
he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us, when he goes to 
t&rsquo; Grange?&nbsp; This is t&rsquo; way on &rsquo;t:&mdash;up
at sun-down: dice, brandy, cloised shutters, und 
can&rsquo;le-light till next day at noon: then, t&rsquo;fooil 
gangs banning und raving to his cham&rsquo;er, makking dacent 
fowks dig thur fingers i&rsquo; thur lugs fur varry shame; 
un&rsquo; the knave, why he can caint his brass, un&rsquo; ate, 
un&rsquo; sleep, un&rsquo; off to his neighbour&rsquo;s to gossip
wi&rsquo; t&rsquo; wife.&nbsp; I&rsquo; course, he tells Dame 
Catherine how her fathur&rsquo;s goold runs into his pocket, and 
her fathur&rsquo;s son gallops down t&rsquo; broad road, while he
flees afore to oppen t&rsquo; pikes!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, Miss 
Linton, Joseph is an old rascal, but no liar; and, if his account
of Heathcliff&rsquo;s conduct be true, you would never think of 
desiring such a husband, would you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!&rsquo; she 
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not listen to your 
slanders.&nbsp; What malevolence you must have to wish to 
convince me that there is no happiness in the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself,
or persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had 
little time to reflect.&nbsp; The day after, there was a 
justice-meeting at the next town; my master was obliged to 
attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his absence, called rather 
earlier than usual.&nbsp; Catherine and Isabella were sitting in 
the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter alarmed at 
her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of her 
secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on 
mature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if
she laughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no 
laughing matter to her.&nbsp; She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff
pass the window.&nbsp; I was sweeping the hearth, and I noticed a
mischievous smile on her lips.&nbsp; Isabella, absorbed in her 
meditations, or a book, remained till the door opened; and it was
too late to attempt an escape, which she would gladly have done 
had it been practicable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come in, that&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; exclaimed the 
mistress, gaily, pulling a chair to the fire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here 
are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between 
them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.&nbsp;
Heathcliff, I&rsquo;m proud to show you, at last, somebody that 
dotes on you more than myself.&nbsp; I expect you to feel 
flattered.&nbsp; Nay, it&rsquo;s not Nelly; don&rsquo;t look at 
her!&nbsp; My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart by 
mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty.&nbsp; It 
lies in your own power to be Edgar&rsquo;s brother!&nbsp; No, no,
Isabella, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t run off,&rsquo; she continued, 
arresting, with feigned playfulness, the confounded girl, who had
risen indignantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;We were quarrelling like cats 
about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations 
of devotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if
I would but have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she 
will have herself to be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that 
would fix you for ever, and send my image into eternal 
oblivion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine!&rsquo; said Isabella, calling up her 
dignity, and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that 
held her, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d thank you to adhere to the truth and 
not slander me, even in joke!&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff, be kind 
enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that 
you and I are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is 
painful to me beyond expression.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked 
thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning 
him, she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to 
her tormentor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By no means!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Linton in answer.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be named a dog in the manger again.&nbsp; 
You <i>shall</i> stay: now then!&nbsp; Heathcliff, why 
don&rsquo;t you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news?&nbsp; 
Isabella swears that the love Edgar has for me is nothing to that
she entertains for you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure she made some speech
of the kind; did she not, Ellen?&nbsp; And she has fasted ever 
since the day before yesterday&rsquo;s walk, from sorrow and rage
that I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its 
being unacceptable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you belie her,&rsquo; said Heathcliff, twisting
his chair to face them.&nbsp; &lsquo;She wishes to be out of my 
society now, at any rate!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do
at a strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for 
instance, which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the 
aversion it raises.&nbsp; The poor thing couldn&rsquo;t bear 
that; she grew white and red in rapid succession, and, while 
tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength of her small fingers 
to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and perceiving that as 
fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down, 
and she could not remove the whole together, she began to make 
use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the 
detainer&rsquo;s with crescents of red.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a tigress!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Linton, 
setting her free, and shaking her hand with pain.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Begone, for God&rsquo;s sake, and hide your vixen 
face!&nbsp; How foolish to reveal those talons to him.&nbsp; 
Can&rsquo;t you fancy the conclusions he&rsquo;ll draw?&nbsp; 
Look, Heathcliff! they are instruments that will do 
execution&mdash;you must beware of your eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d wrench them off her fingers, if they ever 
menaced me,&rsquo; he answered, brutally, when the door had 
closed after her.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what did you mean by teasing 
the creature in that manner, Cathy?&nbsp; You were not speaking 
the truth, were you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I assure you I was,&rsquo; she returned.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;She has been dying for your sake several weeks, and raving
about you this morning, and pouring forth a deluge of abuse, 
because I represented your failings in a plain light, for the 
purpose of mitigating her adoration.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t notice
it further: I wished to punish her sauciness, that&rsquo;s 
all.&nbsp; I like her too well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you 
absolutely seize and devour her up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I like her too ill to attempt it,&rsquo; said he, 
&lsquo;except in a very ghoulish fashion.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d hear 
of odd things if I lived alone with that mawkish, waxen face: the
most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the 
rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or two: they 
detestably resemble Linton&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Delectably!&rsquo; observed Catherine.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;They are dove&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;angel&rsquo;s!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s her brother&rsquo;s heir, is she 
not?&rsquo; he asked, after a brief silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be sorry to think so,&rsquo; returned his 
companion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Half a dozen nephews shall erase her 
title, please heaven!&nbsp; Abstract your mind from the subject 
at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour&rsquo;s 
goods; remember <i>this</i> neighbour&rsquo;s goods are 
mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they were <i>mine</i>, they would be none the less 
that,&rsquo; said Heathcliff; &lsquo;but though Isabella Linton 
may be silly, she is scarcely mad; and, in short, we&rsquo;ll 
dismiss the matter, as you advise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, 
probably, from her thoughts.&nbsp; The other, I felt certain, 
recalled it often in the course of the evening.&nbsp; I saw him 
smile to himself&mdash;grin rather&mdash;and lapse into ominous 
musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from the 
apartment.</p>
<p>I determined to watch his movements.&nbsp; My heart invariably
cleaved to the master&rsquo;s, in preference to Catherine&rsquo;s
side: with reason I imagined, for he was kind, and trustful, and 
honourable; and she&mdash;she could not be called 
<i>opposite</i>, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide 
latitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still 
less sympathy for her feelings.&nbsp; I wanted something to 
happen which might have the effect of freeing both Wuthering 
Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heathcliff quietly; leaving us as 
we had been prior to his advent.&nbsp; His visits were a 
continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master 
also.&nbsp; His abode at the Heights was an oppression past 
explaining.&nbsp; I felt that God had forsaken the stray sheep 
there to its own wicked wanderings, and an evil beast prowled 
between it and the fold, waiting his time to spring and 
destroy.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, 
I&rsquo;ve got up in a sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go 
see how all was at the farm.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve persuaded my 
conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked 
regarding his ways; and then I&rsquo;ve recollected his confirmed
bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from 
re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be 
taken at my word.</p>
<p>One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a 
journey to Gimmerton.&nbsp; It was about the period that my 
narrative has reached: a bright frosty afternoon; the ground 
bare, and the road hard and dry.&nbsp; I came to a stone where 
the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand; a 
rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north side, 
on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G.&nbsp; It serves as 
a guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village.&nbsp; The 
sun shone yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I 
cannot say why, but all at once a gush of child&rsquo;s 
sensations flowed into my heart.&nbsp; Hindley and I held it a 
favourite spot twenty years before.&nbsp; I gazed long at the 
weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the
bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond
of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as 
reality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on 
the withered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his 
little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Poor Hindley!&rsquo; I exclaimed, involuntarily.&nbsp; I 
started: my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that 
the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine!&nbsp; It
vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an irresistible 
yearning to be at the Heights.&nbsp; Superstition urged me to 
comply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead!&nbsp; I 
thought&mdash;or should die soon!&mdash;supposing it were a sign 
of death!&nbsp; The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I
grew; and on catching sight of it I trembled in every limb.&nbsp;
The apparition had outstripped me: it stood looking through the 
gate.&nbsp; That was my first idea on observing an elf-locked, 
brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the 
bars.&nbsp; Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton, 
<i>my</i> Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten 
months since.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God bless thee, darling!&rsquo; I cried, forgetting 
instantaneously my foolish fears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hareton, 
it&rsquo;s Nelly!&nbsp; Nelly, thy nurse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He retreated out of arm&rsquo;s length, and picked up a large 
flint.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am come to see thy father, Hareton,&rsquo; I added, 
guessing from the action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory 
at all, was not recognised as one with me.</p>
<p>He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing 
speech, but could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; 
and then ensued, from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a
string of curses, which, whether he comprehended them or not, 
were delivered with practised emphasis, and distorted his baby 
features into a shocking expression of malignity.&nbsp; You may 
be certain this grieved more than angered me.&nbsp; Fit to cry, I
took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate 
him.&nbsp; He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as if
he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him.&nbsp; I 
showed another, keeping it out of his reach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?&rsquo; I
inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;The curate?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn the curate, and thee!&nbsp; Gie me that,&rsquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have 
it,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s your 
master?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Devil daddy,&rsquo; was his answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what do you learn from daddy?&rsquo; I 
continued.</p>
<p>He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher.&nbsp; &lsquo;What 
does he teach you?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Naught,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but to keep out of his 
gait.&nbsp; Daddy cannot bide me, because I swear at 
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?&rsquo;
I observed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay&mdash;nay,&rsquo; he drawled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay!&rsquo; he answered again.</p>
<p>Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only 
gather the sentences&mdash;&lsquo;I known&rsquo;t: he pays dad 
back what he gies to me&mdash;he curses daddy for cursing 
me.&nbsp; He says I mun do as I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the curate does not teach you to read and write, 
then?&rsquo; I pursued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I was told the curate should have his&mdash;teeth 
dashed down his&mdash;throat, if he stepped over the 
threshold&mdash;Heathcliff had promised that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father 
that a woman called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by 
the garden gate.&nbsp; He went up the walk, and entered the 
house; but, instead of Hindley, Heathcliff appeared on the 
door-stones; and I turned directly and ran down the road as hard 
as ever I could race, making no halt till I gained the 
guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a 
goblin.&nbsp; This is not much connected with Miss 
Isabella&rsquo;s affair: except that it urged me to resolve 
further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to cheek 
the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I 
should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s 
pleasure.</p>
<p>The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be 
feeding some pigeons in the court.&nbsp; She had never spoken a 
word to her sister-in-law for three days; but she had likewise 
dropped her fretful complaining, and we found it a great 
comfort.&nbsp; Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single
unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew.&nbsp; Now, as soon 
as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping 
survey of the house-front.&nbsp; I was standing by the 
kitchen-window, but I drew out of sight.&nbsp; He then stepped 
across the pavement to her, and said something: she seemed 
embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he laid
his hand on her arm.&nbsp; She averted her face: he apparently 
put some question which she had no mind to answer.&nbsp; There 
was another rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself 
unseen, the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Judas!&nbsp; Traitor!&rsquo; I ejaculated.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You are a hypocrite, too, are you?&nbsp; A deliberate 
deceiver.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is, Nelly?&rsquo; said Catherine&rsquo;s voice at 
my elbow: I had been over-intent on watching the pair outside to 
mark her entrance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your worthless friend!&rsquo; I answered, warmly: 
&lsquo;the sneaking rascal yonder.&nbsp; Ah, he has caught a 
glimpse of us&mdash;he is coming in!&nbsp; I wonder will he have 
the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to Miss, 
when he told you he hated her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the 
garden; and a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door.&nbsp; I 
couldn&rsquo;t withhold giving some loose to my indignation; but 
Catherine angrily insisted on silence, and threatened to order me
out of the kitchen, if I dared to be so presumptuous as to put in
my insolent tongue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To hear you, people might think you were the 
mistress!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;You want setting down in
your right place!&nbsp; Heathcliff, what are you about, raising 
this stir?&nbsp; I said you must let Isabella alone!&mdash;I beg 
you will, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish 
Linton to draw the bolts against you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God forbid that he should try!&rsquo; answered the 
black villain.&nbsp; I detested him just then.&nbsp; &lsquo;God 
keep him meek and patient!&nbsp; Every day I grow madder after 
sending him to heaven!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Catherine, shutting the inner 
door!&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t vex me.&nbsp; Why have you 
disregarded my request?&nbsp; Did she come across you on 
purpose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it to you?&rsquo; he growled.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
have a right to kiss her, if she chooses; and you have no right 
to object.&nbsp; I am not <i>your</i> husband: <i>you</i> 
needn&rsquo;t be jealous of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not jealous of you,&rsquo; replied the 
mistress; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m jealous for you.&nbsp; Clear your 
face: you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t scowl at me!&nbsp; If you like 
Isabella, you shall marry her.&nbsp; But do you like her?&nbsp; 
Tell the truth, Heathcliff!&nbsp; There, you won&rsquo;t 
answer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m certain you don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying 
that man?&rsquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Linton should approve,&rsquo; returned my lady, 
decisively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He might spare himself the trouble,&rsquo; said 
Heathcliff: &lsquo;I could do as well without his 
approbation.&nbsp; And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to 
speak a few words now, while we are at it.&nbsp; I want you to be
aware that I <i>know</i> you have treated me 
infernally&mdash;infernally!&nbsp; Do you hear?&nbsp; And if you 
flatter yourself that I don&rsquo;t perceive it, you are a fool; 
and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an 
idiot: and if you fancy I&rsquo;ll suffer unrevenged, I&rsquo;ll 
convince you of the contrary, in a very little while!&nbsp; 
Meantime, thank you for telling me your sister-in-law&rsquo;s 
secret: I swear I&rsquo;ll make the most of it.&nbsp; And stand 
you aside!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What new phase of his character is this?&rsquo; 
exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in amazement.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve 
treated you infernally&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll take your 
revenge!&nbsp; How will you take it, ungrateful brute?&nbsp; How 
have I treated you infernally?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I seek no revenge on you,&rsquo; replied Heathcliff, 
less vehemently.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not the plan.&nbsp; 
The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don&rsquo;t turn 
against him; they crush those beneath them.&nbsp; You are welcome
to torture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse
myself a little in the same style, and refrain from insult as 
much as you are able.&nbsp; Having levelled my palace, 
don&rsquo;t erect a hovel and complacently admire your own 
charity in giving me that for a home.&nbsp; If I imagined you 
really wished me to marry Isabel, I&rsquo;d cut my 
throat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, the evil is that I am <i>not</i> jealous, is 
it?&rsquo; cried Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t 
repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering Satan a lost 
soul.&nbsp; Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting 
misery.&nbsp; You prove it.&nbsp; Edgar is restored from the 
ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; I begin to be secure 
and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace, appear 
resolved on exciting a quarrel.&nbsp; Quarrel with Edgar, if you 
please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you&rsquo;ll hit on 
exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on 
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The conversation ceased.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton sat down by the 
fire, flushed and gloomy.&nbsp; The spirit which served her was 
growing intractable: she could neither lay nor control it.&nbsp; 
He stood on the hearth with folded arms, brooding on his evil 
thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek the master, 
who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen,&rsquo; said he, when I entered, &lsquo;have you 
seen your mistress?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; she&rsquo;s in the kitchen, sir,&rsquo; I 
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s sadly put out by Mr. 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it&rsquo;s 
time to arrange his visits on another footing.&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s harm in being too soft, and now it&rsquo;s come to 
this&mdash;.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I related the scene in the court, 
and, as near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute.&nbsp; I 
fancied it could not be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless 
she made it so afterwards, by assuming the defensive for her 
guest.&nbsp; Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me to the 
close.&nbsp; His first words revealed that he did not clear his 
wife of blame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is insufferable!&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;It is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend, 
and force his company on me!&nbsp; Call me two men out of the 
hall, Ellen.&nbsp; Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with
the low ruffian&mdash;I have humoured her enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, 
went, followed by me, to the kitchen.&nbsp; Its occupants had 
recommenced their angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was 
scolding with renewed vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window,
and hung his head, somewhat cowed by her violent rating 
apparently.&nbsp; He saw the master first, and made a hasty 
motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed, abruptly, on 
discovering the reason of his intimation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is this?&rsquo; said Linton, addressing her; 
&lsquo;what notion of propriety must you have to remain here, 
after the language which has been held to you by that 
blackguard?&nbsp; I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you 
think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, 
perhaps, imagine I can get used to it too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?&rsquo; 
asked the mistress, in a tone particularly calculated to provoke 
her husband, implying both carelessness and contempt of his 
irritation.&nbsp; Heathcliff, who had raised his eyes at the 
former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on purpose, 
it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton&rsquo;s attention to him.&nbsp; He 
succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high 
flights of passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been so far forbearing with you, sir,&rsquo;
he said quietly; &lsquo;not that I was ignorant of your 
miserable, degraded character, but I felt you were only partly 
responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your 
acquaintance, I acquiesced&mdash;foolishly.&nbsp; Your presence 
is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for 
that cause, and to prevent worse consequences, I shall deny you 
hereafter admission into this house, and give notice now that I 
require your instant departure.&nbsp; Three minutes&rsquo; delay 
will render it involuntary and ignominious.</p>
<p>Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with
an eye full of derision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!&rsquo;
he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is in danger of splitting its skull 
against my knuckles.&nbsp; By God!&nbsp; Mr. Linton, I&rsquo;m 
mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!&rsquo;</p>
<p>My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch 
the men: he had no intention of hazarding a personal 
encounter.&nbsp; I obeyed the hint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting 
something, followed; and when I attempted to call them, she 
pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fair means!&rsquo; she said, in answer to her 
husband&rsquo;s look of angry surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you have 
not courage to attack him, make an apology, or allow yourself to 
be beaten.&nbsp; It will correct you of feigning more valour than
you possess.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll swallow the key before you 
shall get it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m delightfully rewarded for my 
kindness to each!&nbsp; After constant indulgence of one&rsquo;s 
weak nature, and the other&rsquo;s bad one, I earn for thanks two
samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity!&nbsp; Edgar, I
was defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you 
sick, for daring to think an evil thought of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that 
effect on the master.&nbsp; He tried to wrest the key from 
Catherine&rsquo;s grasp, and for safety she flung it into the 
hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was taken with a 
nervous trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale.&nbsp; 
For his life he could not avert that excess of emotion: mingled 
anguish and humiliation overcame him completely.&nbsp; He leant 
on the back of a chair, and covered his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, heavens!&nbsp; In old days this would win you 
knighthood!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are 
vanquished! we are vanquished!&nbsp; Heathcliff would as soon 
lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a 
colony of mice.&nbsp; Cheer up! you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be 
hurt!&nbsp; Your type is not a lamb, it&rsquo;s a sucking 
leveret.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, 
Cathy!&rsquo; said her friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;I compliment you on 
your taste.&nbsp; And that is the slavering, shivering thing you 
preferred to me!&nbsp; I would not strike him with my fist, but 
I&rsquo;d kick him with my foot, and experience considerable 
satisfaction.&nbsp; Is he weeping, or is he going to faint for 
fear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton 
rested a push.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d better have kept his distance: my
master quickly sprang erect, and struck him full on the throat a 
blow that would have levelled a slighter man.&nbsp; It took his 
breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr. Linton walked out 
by the back door into the yard, and from thence to the front 
entrance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There! you&rsquo;ve done with coming here,&rsquo; cried
Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get away, now; he&rsquo;ll return with a 
brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants.&nbsp; If he did 
overhear us, of course he&rsquo;d never forgive you.&nbsp; 
You&rsquo;ve played me an ill turn, Heathcliff!&nbsp; But 
go&mdash;make haste!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather see Edgar at bay than
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you suppose I&rsquo;m going with that blow burning 
in my gullet?&rsquo; he thundered.&nbsp; &lsquo;By hell, 
no!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut 
before I cross the threshold!&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t floor him 
now, I shall murder him some time; so, as you value his 
existence, let me get at him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not coming,&rsquo; I interposed, framing a bit of
a lie.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the coachman and the two 
gardeners; you&rsquo;ll surely not wait to be thrust into the 
road by them!&nbsp; Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very 
likely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they 
fulfil his orders.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gardeners and coachman were there: but Linton was with 
them.&nbsp; They had already entered the court.&nbsp; Heathcliff,
on the second thoughts, resolved to avoid a struggle against 
three underlings: he seized the poker, smashed the lock from the 
inner door, and made his escape as they tramped in.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her 
up-stairs.&nbsp; She did not know my share in contributing to the
disturbance, and I was anxious to keep her in ignorance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m nearly distracted, Nelly!&rsquo; she 
exclaimed, throwing herself on the sofa.&nbsp; &lsquo;A thousand 
smiths&rsquo; hammers are beating in my head!&nbsp; Tell Isabella
to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any 
one else aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild.&nbsp; 
And, Nelly, say to Edgar, if you see him again to-night, that 
I&rsquo;m in danger of being seriously ill.&nbsp; I wish it may 
prove true.&nbsp; He has startled and distressed me 
shockingly!&nbsp; I want to frighten him.&nbsp; Besides, he might
come and begin a string of abuse or complainings; I&rsquo;m 
certain I should recriminate, and God knows where we should 
end!&nbsp; Will you do so, my good Nelly?&nbsp; You are aware 
that I am no way blamable in this matter.&nbsp; What possessed 
him to turn listener?&nbsp; Heathcliff&rsquo;s talk was 
outrageous, after you left us; but I could soon have diverted him
from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing.&nbsp; Now all is 
dashed wrong; by the fool&rsquo;s craving to hear evil of self, 
that haunts some people like a demon!&nbsp; Had Edgar never 
gathered our conversation, he would never have been the worse for
it.&nbsp; Really, when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone 
of displeasure after I had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse 
for him, I did not care hardly what they did to each other; 
especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we should 
all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long!&nbsp; Well, if I
cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend&mdash;if Edgar will be mean 
and jealous, I&rsquo;ll try to break their hearts by breaking my 
own.&nbsp; That will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am 
pushed to extremity!&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a deed to be reserved 
for a forlorn hope; I&rsquo;d not take Linton by surprise with 
it.&nbsp; To this point he has been discreet in dreading to 
provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that policy,
and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled, on
frenzy.&nbsp; I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that 
countenance, and look rather more anxious about me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no
doubt, rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect 
sincerity; but I believed a person who could plan the turning of 
her fits of passion to account, beforehand, might, by exerting 
her will, manage to control herself tolerably, even while under 
their influence; and I did not wish to &lsquo;frighten&rsquo; her
husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for the purpose
of serving her selfishness.&nbsp; Therefore I said nothing when I
met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty
of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel
together.&nbsp; He began to speak first.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Remain where you are, Catherine,&rsquo; he said; 
without any anger in his voice, but with much sorrowful 
despondency.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall not stay.&nbsp; I am neither 
come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn 
whether, after this evening&rsquo;s events, you intend to 
continue your intimacy with&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, for mercy&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; interrupted the 
mistress, stamping her foot, &lsquo;for mercy&rsquo;s sake, let 
us hear no more of it now!&nbsp; Your cold blood cannot be worked
into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but mine are 
boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them 
dance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To get rid of me, answer my question,&rsquo; persevered
Mr. Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must answer it; and that violence 
does not alarm me.&nbsp; I have found that you can be as stoical 
as anyone, when you please.&nbsp; Will you give up Heathcliff 
hereafter, or will you give up me?&nbsp; It is impossible for you
to be <i>my</i> friend and <i>his</i> at the same time; and I 
absolutely <i>require</i> to know which you choose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I require to be let alone?&rsquo; exclaimed Catherine, 
furiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;I demand it!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see I 
can scarcely stand?&nbsp; Edgar, you&mdash;you leave 
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered 
leisurely.&nbsp; It was enough to try the temper of a saint, such
senseless, wicked rages!&nbsp; There she lay dashing her head 
against the arm of the sofa, and grinding her teeth, so that you 
might fancy she would crash them to splinters!&nbsp; Mr. Linton 
stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear.&nbsp; He 
told me to fetch some water.&nbsp; She had no breath for 
speaking.&nbsp; I brought a glass full; and as she would not 
drink, I sprinkled it on her face.&nbsp; In a few seconds she 
stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her eyes, while her 
cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of 
death.&nbsp; Linton looked terrified.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is nothing in the world the matter,&rsquo; I 
whispered.&nbsp; I did not want him to yield, though I could not 
help being afraid in my heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has blood on her lips!&rsquo; he said, 
shuddering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind!&rsquo; I answered, tartly.&nbsp; And I told
him how she had resolved, previous to his coming, on exhibiting a
fit of frenzy.&nbsp; I incautiously gave the account aloud, and 
she heard me; for she started up&mdash;her hair flying over her 
shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck and arms 
standing out preternaturally.&nbsp; I made up my mind for broken 
bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, 
and then rushed from the room.&nbsp; The master directed me to 
follow; I did, to her chamber-door: she hindered me from going 
further by securing it against me.</p>
<p>As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I 
went to ask whether she would have some carried up.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;No!&rsquo; she replied, peremptorily.&nbsp; The same 
question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow 
after, and received the same answer.&nbsp; Mr. Linton, on his 
part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire 
concerning his wife&rsquo;s occupations.&nbsp; Isabella and he 
had had an hour&rsquo;s interview, during which he tried to 
elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s advances: but he could make nothing of her 
evasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination 
unsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she 
were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would 
dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always 
silent, and almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself 
up among books that he never opened&mdash;wearying, I guessed, 
with a continual vague expectation that Catherine, repenting her 
conduct, would come of her own accord to ask pardon, and seek a 
reconciliation&mdash;and <i>she</i> fasted pertinaciously, under 
the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was ready to choke 
for her absence, and pride alone held him from running to cast 
himself at her feet; I went about my household duties, convinced 
that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and that 
lodged in my body.&nbsp; I wasted no condolences on Miss, nor any
expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to 
the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady&rsquo;s 
name, since he might not hear her voice.&nbsp; I determined they 
should come about as they pleased for me; and though it was a 
tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice at length in a faint 
dawn of its progress: as I thought at first.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having 
finished the water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed
supply, and a basin of gruel, for she believed she was 
dying.&nbsp; That I set down as a speech meant for Edgar&rsquo;s 
ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it to myself and 
brought her some tea and dry toast.&nbsp; She ate and drank 
eagerly, and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands 
and groaning.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, I will die,&rsquo; she exclaimed, 
&lsquo;since no one cares anything about me.&nbsp; I wish I had 
not taken that.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then a good while after I heard her 
murmur, &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll not die&mdash;he&rsquo;d be 
glad&mdash;he does not love me at all&mdash;he would never miss 
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you want anything, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; I inquired, 
still preserving my external composure, in spite of her ghastly 
countenance and strange, exaggerated manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is that apathetic being doing?&rsquo; she 
demanded, pushing the thick entangled locks from her wasted 
face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has he fallen into a lethargy, or is he 
dead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither,&rsquo; replied I; &lsquo;if you mean Mr. 
Linton.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s tolerably well, I think, though his 
studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is continually
among his books, since he has no other society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition,
but I could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of 
her disorder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Among his books!&rsquo; she cried, confounded.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;And I dying!&nbsp; I on the brink of the grave!&nbsp; My 
God! does he know how I&rsquo;m altered?&rsquo; continued she, 
staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the 
opposite wall.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that Catherine Linton?&nbsp;&nbsp;
He imagines me in a pet&mdash;in play, perhaps.&nbsp; Cannot you 
inform him that it is frightful earnest?&nbsp; Nelly, if it be 
not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I&rsquo;ll choose 
between these two: either to starve at once&mdash;that would be 
no punishment unless he had a heart&mdash;or to recover, and 
leave the country.&nbsp; Are you speaking the truth about him 
now?&nbsp; Take care.&nbsp; Is he actually so utterly indifferent
for my life?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;the master 
has no idea of your being deranged; and of course he does not 
fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think not?&nbsp; Cannot you tell him I will?&rsquo;
she returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Persuade him! speak of your own mind: 
say you are certain I will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,&rsquo; I suggested, 
&lsquo;that you have eaten some food with a relish this evening, 
and to-morrow you will perceive its good effects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I were only sure it would kill him,&rsquo; she 
interrupted, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d kill myself directly!&nbsp; These 
three awful nights I&rsquo;ve never closed my lids&mdash;and oh, 
I&rsquo;ve been tormented!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been haunted, 
Nelly!&nbsp; But I begin to fancy you don&rsquo;t like me.&nbsp; 
How strange!&nbsp; I thought, though everybody hated and despised
each other, they could not avoid loving me.&nbsp; And they have 
all turned to enemies in a few hours: they have, I&rsquo;m 
positive; the people here.&nbsp; How dreary to meet death, 
surrounded by their cold faces!&nbsp; Isabella, terrified and 
repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be so dreadful to 
watch Catherine go.&nbsp; And Edgar standing solemnly by to see 
it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring 
peace to his house, and going back to his <i>books</i>!&nbsp; 
What in the name of all that feels has he to do with 
<i>books</i>, when I am dying?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of
Mr. Linton&rsquo;s philosophical resignation.&nbsp; Tossing 
about, she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness, and 
tore the pillow with her teeth; then raising herself up all 
burning, desired that I would open the window.&nbsp; We were in 
the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the north-east, 
and I objected.&nbsp; Both the expressions flitting over her 
face, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; 
and brought to my recollection her former illness, and the 
doctor&rsquo;s injunction that she should not be crossed.&nbsp; A
minute previously she was violent; now, supported on one arm, and
not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed to find childish 
diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just 
made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different 
species: her mind had strayed to other associations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a turkey&rsquo;s,&rsquo; she murmured to 
herself; &lsquo;and this is a wild duck&rsquo;s; and this is a 
pigeon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Ah, they put pigeons&rsquo; feathers in the
pillows&mdash;no wonder I couldn&rsquo;t die!&nbsp; Let me take 
care to throw it on the floor when I lie down.&nbsp; And here is 
a moor-cock&rsquo;s; and this&mdash;I should know it among a 
thousand&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lapwing&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Bonny bird; 
wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor.&nbsp; It 
wanted to get to its nest, for the clouds had touched the swells,
and it felt rain coming.&nbsp; This feather was picked up from 
the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its nest in the winter, 
full of little skeletons.&nbsp; Heathcliff set a trap over it, 
and the old ones dared not come.&nbsp; I made him promise 
he&rsquo;d never shoot a lapwing after that, and he 
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Yes, here are more!&nbsp; Did he shoot my 
lapwings, Nelly?&nbsp; Are they red, any of them?&nbsp; Let me 
look.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give over with that baby-work!&rsquo; I interrupted, 
dragging the pillow away, and turning the holes towards the 
mattress, for she was removing its contents by handfuls.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Lie down and shut your eyes: you&rsquo;re wandering.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a mess!&nbsp; The down is flying about like 
snow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I went here and there collecting it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see in you, Nelly,&rsquo; she continued dreamily, 
&lsquo;an aged woman: you have grey hair and bent 
shoulders.&nbsp; This bed is the fairy cave under Penistone 
crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers; 
pretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of 
wool.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll come to fifty years 
hence: I know you are not so now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not wandering: 
you&rsquo;re mistaken, or else I should believe you really 
<i>were</i> that withered hag, and I should think I <i>was</i> 
under Penistone Crags; and I&rsquo;m conscious it&rsquo;s night, 
and there are two candles on the table making the black press 
shine like jet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The black press? where is that?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You are talking in your sleep!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s against the wall, as it always is,&rsquo; 
she replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;It <i>does</i> appear odd&mdash;I see a
face in it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no press in the room, and never 
was,&rsquo; said I, resuming my seat, and looping up the curtain 
that I might watch her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> see that face?&rsquo; she 
inquired, gazing earnestly at the mirror.</p>
<p>And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend
it to be her own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s behind there still!&rsquo; she pursued, 
anxiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;And it stirred.&nbsp; Who is it?&nbsp; I 
hope it will not come out when you are gone!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; 
Nelly, the room is haunted!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid of being 
alone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a 
succession of shudders convulsed her frame, and she would keep 
straining her gaze towards the glass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nobody here!&rsquo; I insisted.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;It was <i>yourself</i>, Mrs. Linton: you knew it a while 
since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Myself!&rsquo; she gasped, &lsquo;and the clock is 
striking twelve!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true, then! that&rsquo;s 
dreadful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her 
eyes.&nbsp; I attempted to steal to the door with an intention of
calling her husband; but I was summoned back by a piercing 
shriek&mdash;the shawl had dropped from the frame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what is the matter?&rsquo; cried I.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Who is coward now?&nbsp; Wake up!&nbsp; That is the 
glass&mdash;the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, 
and there am I too by your side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror 
gradually passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to
a glow of shame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear!&nbsp; I thought I was at home,&rsquo; she 
sighed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought I was lying in my chamber at 
Wuthering Heights.&nbsp; Because I&rsquo;m weak, my brain got 
confused, and I screamed unconsciously.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say 
anything; but stay with me.&nbsp; I dread sleeping: my dreams 
appal me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A sound sleep would do you good, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; I 
answered: &lsquo;and I hope this suffering will prevent your 
trying starving again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old 
house!&rsquo; she went on bitterly, wringing her hands.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;And that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice.&nbsp; 
Do let me feel it&mdash;it comes straight down the moor&mdash;do 
let me have one breath!&rsquo;&nbsp; To pacify her I held the 
casement ajar a few seconds.&nbsp; A cold blast rushed through; I
closed it, and returned to my post.&nbsp; She lay still now, her 
face bathed in tears.&nbsp; Exhaustion of body had entirely 
subdued her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a 
wailing child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long is it since I shut myself in here?&rsquo; she 
asked, suddenly reviving.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was Monday evening,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;and 
this is Thursday night, or rather Friday morning, at 
present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! of the same week?&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Only that brief time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and 
ill-temper,&rsquo; observed I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it seems a weary number of hours,&rsquo; she 
muttered doubtfully: &lsquo;it must be more.&nbsp; I remember 
being in the parlour after they had quarrelled, and Edgar being 
cruelly provoking, and me running into this room desperate.&nbsp;
As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness 
overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t 
explain to Edgar how certain I felt of having a fit, or going 
raging mad, if he persisted in teasing me!&nbsp; I had no command
of tongue, or brain, and he did not guess my agony, perhaps: it 
barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his 
voice.&nbsp; Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it 
began to be dawn, and, Nelly, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I thought,
and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my 
reason.&nbsp; I thought as I lay there, with my head against that
table leg, and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the 
window, that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and 
my heart ached with some great grief which, just waking, I could 
not recollect.&nbsp; I pondered, and worried myself to discover 
what it could be, and, most strangely, the whole last seven years
of my life grew a blank!&nbsp; I did not recall that they had 
been at all.&nbsp; I was a child; my father was just buried, and 
my misery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered 
between me and Heathcliff.&nbsp; I was laid alone, for the first 
time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping, I
lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck the 
table-top!&nbsp; I swept it along the carpet, and then memory 
burst in: my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of 
despair.&nbsp; I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched: it 
must have been temporary derangement; for there is scarcely 
cause.&nbsp; But, supposing at twelve years old I had been 
wrenched from the Heights, and every early association, and my 
all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and been converted at
a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and 
the wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from 
what had been my world.&nbsp; You may fancy a glimpse of the 
abyss where I grovelled!&nbsp; Shake your head as you will, 
Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me!&nbsp; You should have 
spoken to Edgar, indeed you should, and compelled him to leave me
quiet!&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m burning!&nbsp; I wish I were out of 
doors!&nbsp; I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, 
and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening under 
them!&nbsp; Why am I so changed? why does my blood rush into a 
hell of tumult at a few words?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I should be 
myself were I once among the heather on those hills.&nbsp; Open 
the window again wide: fasten it open!&nbsp; Quick, why 
don&rsquo;t you move?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I won&rsquo;t give you your death of 
cold,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t give me a chance of life, you 
mean,&rsquo; she said, sullenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;However, I&rsquo;m 
not helpless yet; I&rsquo;ll open it myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she 
crossed the room, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and 
bent out, careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders
as keen as a knife.&nbsp; I entreated, and finally attempted to 
force her to retire.&nbsp; But I soon found her delirious 
strength much surpassed mine (she was delirious, I became 
convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings).&nbsp; There was
no moon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a 
light gleamed from any house, far or near all had been 
extinguished long ago: and those at Wuthering Heights were never 
visible&mdash;still she asserted she caught their shining.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look!&rsquo; she cried eagerly, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s my 
room with the candle in it, and the trees swaying before it; and 
the other candle is in Joseph&rsquo;s garret.&nbsp; Joseph sits 
up late, doesn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s waiting till I come 
home that he may lock the gate.&nbsp; Well, he&rsquo;ll wait a 
while yet.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a rough journey, and a sad heart to 
travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton Kirk to go that 
journey!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve braved its ghosts often together, and 
dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to 
come.&nbsp; But, Heathcliff, if I dare you now, will you 
venture?&nbsp; If you do, I&rsquo;ll keep you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll 
not lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep, and 
throw the church down over me, but I won&rsquo;t rest till you 
are with me.&nbsp; I never will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and resumed with a strange smile.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s considering&mdash;he&rsquo;d rather I&rsquo;d 
come to him!&nbsp; Find a way, then! not through that 
kirkyard.&nbsp; You are slow!&nbsp; Be content, you always 
followed me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was 
planning how I could reach something to wrap about her, without 
quitting my hold of herself (for I could not trust her alone by 
the gaping lattice), when, to my consternation, I heard the 
rattle of the door-handle, and Mr. Linton entered.&nbsp; He had 
only then come from the library; and, in passing through the 
lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity, 
or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, sir!&rsquo; I cried, checking the exclamation risen
to his lips at the sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere 
of the chamber.&nbsp; &lsquo;My poor mistress is ill, and she 
quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all; pray, come and 
persuade her to go to bed.&nbsp; Forget your anger, for 
she&rsquo;s hard to guide any way but her own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine ill?&rsquo; he said, hastening to us.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Shut the window, Ellen!&nbsp; Catherine! 
why&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was silent.&nbsp; The haggardness of Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s 
appearance smote him speechless, and he could only glance from 
her to me in horrified astonishment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s been fretting here,&rsquo; I continued, 
&lsquo;and eating scarcely anything, and never complaining: she 
would admit none of us till this evening, and so we 
couldn&rsquo;t inform you of her state, as we were not aware of 
it ourselves; but it is nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master 
frowned.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?&rsquo; he
said sternly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You shall account more clearly for 
keeping me ignorant of this!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he took his wife in
his arms, and looked at her with anguish.</p>
<p>At first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was 
invisible to her abstracted gaze.&nbsp; The delirium was not 
fixed, however; having weaned her eyes from contemplating the 
outer darkness, by degrees she centred her attention on him, and 
discovered who it was that held her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?&rsquo; she 
said, with angry animation.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are one of those 
things that are ever found when least wanted, and when you are 
wanted, never!&nbsp; I suppose we shall have plenty of 
lamentations now&mdash;I see we shall&mdash;but they can&rsquo;t 
keep me from my narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where 
I&rsquo;m bound before spring is over!&nbsp; There it is: not 
among the Lintons, mind, under the chapel-roof, but in the open 
air, with a head-stone; and you may please yourself whether you 
go to them or come to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine, what have you done?&rsquo; commenced the 
master.&nbsp; &lsquo;Am I nothing to you any more?&nbsp; Do you 
love that wretch Heath&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hush, this
moment!&nbsp; You mention that name and I end the matter 
instantly by a spring from the window!&nbsp; What you touch at 
present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top before
you lay hands on me again.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you, Edgar: 
I&rsquo;m past wanting you.&nbsp; Return to your books.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m glad you possess a consolation, for all you had in me 
is gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her mind wanders, sir,&rsquo; I interposed.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;She has been talking nonsense the whole evening; but let 
her have quiet, and proper attendance, and she&rsquo;ll 
rally.&nbsp; Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex 
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I desire no further advice from you,&rsquo; answered 
Mr. Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;You knew your mistress&rsquo;s nature, 
and you encouraged me to harass her.&nbsp; And not to give me one
hint of how she has been these three days!&nbsp; It was 
heartless!&nbsp; Months of sickness could not cause such a 
change!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for
another&rsquo;s wicked waywardness.&nbsp; &lsquo;I knew Mrs. 
Linton&rsquo;s nature to be headstrong and domineering,&rsquo; 
cried I: &lsquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know that you wished to foster
her fierce temper!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know that, to humour her,
I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff.&nbsp; I performed the duty of a 
faithful servant in telling you, and I have got a faithful 
servant&rsquo;s wages!&nbsp; Well, it will teach me to be careful
next time.&nbsp; Next time you may gather intelligence for 
yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my 
service, Ellen Dean,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, 
then, Mr. Linton?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Heathcliff has your
permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to drop in at every 
opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison the 
mistress against you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our
conversation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; Nelly has played traitor,&rsquo; she 
exclaimed, passionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nelly is my hidden 
enemy.&nbsp; You witch!&nbsp; So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt 
us!&nbsp; Let me go, and I&rsquo;ll make her rue!&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll make her howl a recantation!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A maniac&rsquo;s fury kindled under her brows; she struggled 
desperately to disengage herself from Linton&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; 
I felt no inclination to tarry the event; and, resolving to seek 
medical aid on my own responsibility, I quitted the chamber.</p>
<p>In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a 
bridle hook is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved 
irregularly, evidently by another agent than the wind.&nbsp; 
Notwithstanding my hurry, I stayed to examine it, lest ever after
I should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it 
was a creature of the other world.&nbsp; My surprise and 
perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than vision, 
Miss Isabella&rsquo;s springer, Fanny, suspended by a 
handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp.&nbsp; I quickly 
released the animal, and lifted it into the garden.&nbsp; I had 
seen it follow its mistress up-stairs when she went to bed; and 
wondered much how it could have got out there, and what 
mischievous person had treated it so.&nbsp; While untying the 
knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I repeatedly caught the
beat of horses&rsquo; feet galloping at some distance; but there 
were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I 
hardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange 
sound, in that place, at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see
a patient in the village as I came up the street; and my account 
of Catherine Linton&rsquo;s malady induced him to accompany me 
back immediately.&nbsp; He was a plain rough man; and he made no 
scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack; 
unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had 
shown herself before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nelly Dean,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help 
fancying there&rsquo;s an extra cause for this.&nbsp; What has 
there been to do at the Grange?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve odd reports up 
here.&nbsp; A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill
for a trifle; and that sort of people should not either.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s hard work bringing them through fevers, and such 
things.&nbsp; How did it begin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The master will inform you,&rsquo; I answered; 
&lsquo;but you are acquainted with the Earnshaws&rsquo; violent 
dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all.&nbsp; I may say 
this; it commenced in a quarrel.&nbsp; She was struck during a 
tempest of passion with a kind of fit.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s her 
account, at least: for she flew off in the height of it, and 
locked herself up.&nbsp; Afterwards, she refused to eat, and now 
she alternately raves and remains in a half dream; knowing those 
about her, but having her mind filled with all sorts of strange 
ideas and illusions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Linton will be sorry?&rsquo; observed Kenneth, 
interrogatively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sorry? he&rsquo;ll break his heart should anything 
happen!&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm him more
than necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I told him to beware,&rsquo; said my companion; 
&lsquo;and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my 
warning!&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t he been intimate with Mr. Heathcliff 
lately?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,&rsquo; 
answered I, &lsquo;though more on the strength of the mistress 
having known him when a boy, than because the master likes his 
company.&nbsp; At present he&rsquo;s discharged from the trouble 
of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after Miss 
Linton which he manifested.&nbsp; I hardly think he&rsquo;ll be 
taken in again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on 
him?&rsquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s next question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not in her confidence,&rsquo; returned I, 
reluctant to continue the subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, she&rsquo;s a sly one,&rsquo; he remarked, shaking 
his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;She keeps her own counsel!&nbsp; But 
she&rsquo;s a real little fool.&nbsp; I have it from good 
authority that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and 
Heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your 
house above two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but
just mount his horse and away with him!&nbsp; My informant said 
she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be 
prepared on their first meeting after that: when it was to be he 
didn&rsquo;t hear; but you urge Mr. Linton to look 
sharp!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, 
and ran most of the way back.&nbsp; The little dog was yelping in
the garden yet.&nbsp; I spared a minute to open the gate for it, 
but instead of going to the house door, it coursed up and down 
snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the road, had I not
seized it and conveyed it in with me.&nbsp; On ascending to 
Isabella&rsquo;s room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was 
empty.&nbsp; Had I been a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s 
illness might have arrested her rash step.&nbsp; But what could 
be done now?&nbsp; There was a bare possibility of overtaking 
them if pursued instantly.&nbsp; <i>I</i> could not pursue them, 
however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the place 
with confusion; still less unfold the business to my master, 
absorbed as he was in his present calamity, and having no heart 
to spare for a second grief!&nbsp; I saw nothing for it but to 
hold my tongue, and suffer matters to take their course; and 
Kenneth being arrived, I went with a badly composed countenance 
to announce him.&nbsp; Catherine lay in a troubled sleep: her 
husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy; he now 
hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every change of 
her painfully expressive features.</p>
<p>The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully
to him of its having a favourable termination, if we could only 
preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity.&nbsp; To 
me, he signified the threatening danger was not so much death, as
permanent alienation of intellect.</p>
<p>I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: 
indeed, we never went to bed; and the servants were all up long 
before the usual hour, moving through the house with stealthy 
tread, and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in 
their vocations.&nbsp; Every one was active but Miss Isabella; 
and they began to remark how sound she slept: her brother, too, 
asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient for her presence, 
and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her 
sister-in-law.&nbsp; I trembled lest he should send me to call 
her; but I was spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of 
her flight.&nbsp; One of the maids, a thoughtless girl, who had 
been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting up-stairs, 
open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: &lsquo;Oh, 
dear, dear!&nbsp; What mun we have next?&nbsp; Master, master, 
our young lady&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold your noise!&rsquo; cried, I hastily, enraged at 
her clamorous manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speak lower, Mary&mdash;What is the matter?&rsquo; said
Mr. Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;What ails your young lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s gone, she&rsquo;s gone!&nbsp; Yon&rsquo; 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s run off wi&rsquo; her!&rsquo; gasped the 
girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not true!&rsquo; exclaimed Linton, rising in 
agitation.&nbsp; &lsquo;It cannot be: how has the idea entered 
your head?&nbsp; Ellen Dean, go and seek her.&nbsp; It is 
incredible: it cannot be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated
his demand to know her reasons for such an assertion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk 
here,&rsquo; she stammered, &lsquo;and he asked whether we 
weren&rsquo;t in trouble at the Grange.&nbsp; I thought he meant 
for missis&rsquo;s sickness, so I answered, yes.&nbsp; Then says 
he, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody gone after &rsquo;em, I 
guess?&rdquo;&nbsp; I stared.&nbsp; He saw I knew nought about 
it, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a 
horse&rsquo;s shoe fastened at a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, two 
miles out of Gimmerton, not very long after midnight! and how the
blacksmith&rsquo;s lass had got up to spy who they were: she knew
them both directly.&nbsp; And she noticed the 
man&mdash;Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob&rsquo;dy could
mistake him, besides&mdash;put a sovereign in her father&rsquo;s 
hand for payment.&nbsp; The lady had a cloak about her face; but 
having desired a sup of water, while she drank it fell back, and 
she saw her very plain.&nbsp; Heathcliff held both bridles as 
they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and went
as fast as the rough roads would let them.&nbsp; The lass said 
nothing to her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this 
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I ran and peeped, for form&rsquo;s sake, into Isabella&rsquo;s
room; confirming, when I returned, the servant&rsquo;s 
statement.&nbsp; Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by the bed; on 
my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the meaning of my blank 
aspect, and dropped them without giving an order, or uttering a 
word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing 
her back,&rsquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;How should we 
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She went of her own accord,&rsquo; answered the master;
&lsquo;she had a right to go if she pleased.&nbsp; Trouble me no 
more about her.&nbsp; Hereafter she is only my sister in name: 
not because I disown her, but because she has disowned 
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And that was all he said on the subject: he did not make 
single inquiry further, or mention her in any way, except 
directing me to send what property she had in the house to her 
fresh home, wherever it was, when I knew it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>For two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two 
months, Mrs. Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of 
what was denominated a brain fever.&nbsp; No mother could have 
nursed an only child more devotedly than Edgar tended her.&nbsp; 
Day and night he was watching, and patiently enduring all the 
annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could 
inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he saved from the
grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of 
constant future anxiety&mdash;in fact, that his health and 
strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of 
humanity&mdash;he knew no limits in gratitude and joy when 
Catherine&rsquo;s life was declared out of danger; and hour after
hour he would sit beside her, tracing the gradual return to 
bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the 
illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance 
also, and she would soon be entirely her former self.</p>
<p>The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of
the following March.&nbsp; Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in 
the morning, a handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger
to any gleam of pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone 
delighted as she gathered them eagerly together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,&rsquo; 
she exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;They remind me of soft thaw winds, 
and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow.&nbsp; Edgar, is there 
not a south wind, and is not the snow almost gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The snow is quite gone down here, darling,&rsquo; 
replied her husband; &lsquo;and I only see two white spots on the
whole range of moors: the sky is blue, and the larks are singing,
and the becks and brooks are all brim full.&nbsp; Catherine, last
spring at this time, I was longing to have you under this roof; 
now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the air blows 
so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall never be there but once more,&rsquo; said the 
invalid; &lsquo;and then you&rsquo;ll leave me, and I shall 
remain for ever.&nbsp; Next spring you&rsquo;ll long again to 
have me under this roof, and you&rsquo;ll look back and think you
were happy to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to 
cheer her by the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the 
flowers, she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down 
her cheeks unheeding.&nbsp; We knew she was really better, and, 
therefore, decided that long confinement to a single place 
produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially 
removed by a change of scene.&nbsp; The master told me to light a
fire in the many-weeks&rsquo; deserted parlour, and to set an 
easy-chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her
down, and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as 
we expected, revived by the objects round her: which, though 
familiar, were free from the dreary associations investing her 
hated sick chamber.&nbsp; By evening she seemed greatly 
exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that 
apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed, 
till another room could be prepared.&nbsp; To obviate the fatigue
of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where 
you lie at present&mdash;on the same floor with the parlour; and 
she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other, leaning
on Edgar&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; Ah, I thought myself, she might 
recover, so waited on as she was.&nbsp; And there was double 
cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that of 
another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr. 
Linton&rsquo;s heart would be gladdened, and his lands secured 
from a stranger&rsquo;s gripe, by the birth of an heir.</p>
<p>I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six 
weeks from her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage 
with Heathcliff.&nbsp; It appeared dry and cold; but at the 
bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology, and an 
entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation, if her 
proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it
then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it.&nbsp; 
Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight 
more, I got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from 
the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll 
read it: for I keep it yet.&nbsp; Any relic of the dead is 
precious, if they were valued living.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>, it begins,&mdash;I came
last night to Wuthering Heights, and heard, for the first time, 
that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill.&nbsp; I must not 
write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or 
too distressed to answer what I sent him.&nbsp; Still, I must 
write to somebody, and the only choice left me is you.</p>
<p>Inform Edgar that I&rsquo;d give the world to see his face 
again&mdash;that my heart returned to Thrushcross Grange in 
twenty-four hours after I left it, and is there at this moment, 
full of warm feelings for him, and Catherine!&nbsp; <i>I 
can&rsquo;t follow it though</i>&mdash;(these words are 
underlined)&mdash;they need not expect me, and they may draw what
conclusions they please; taking care, however, to lay nothing at 
the door of my weak will or deficient affection.</p>
<p>The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone.&nbsp; I 
want to ask you two questions: the first is,&mdash;How did you 
contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when 
you resided here?&nbsp; I cannot recognise any sentiment which 
those around share with me.</p>
<p>The second question I have great interest in; it is 
this&mdash;Is Mr. Heathcliff a man?&nbsp; If so, is he mad?&nbsp;
And if not, is he a devil?&nbsp; I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t tell my 
reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to explain, if
you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see me; 
and you must call, Ellen, very soon.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t write, but
come, and bring me something from Edgar.</p>
<p>Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, 
as I am led to imagine the Heights will be.&nbsp; It is to amuse 
myself that I dwell on such subjects as the lack of external 
comforts: they never occupy my thoughts, except at the moment 
when I miss them.&nbsp; I should laugh and dance for joy, if I 
found their absence was the total of my miseries, and the rest 
was an unnatural dream!</p>
<p>The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by
that, I judged it to be six o&rsquo;clock; and my companion 
halted half an hour, to inspect the park, and the gardens, and, 
probably, the place itself, as well as he could; so it was dark 
when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farm-house, and your 
old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to receive us by the light
of a dip candle.&nbsp; He did it with a courtesy that redounded 
to his credit.&nbsp; His first act was to elevate his torch to a 
level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, 
and turn away.&nbsp; Then he took the two horses, and led them 
into the stables; reappearing for the purpose of locking the 
outer gate, as if we lived in an ancient castle.</p>
<p>Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the 
kitchen&mdash;a dingy, untidy hole; I daresay you would not know 
it, it is so changed since it was in your charge.&nbsp; By the 
fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb and dirty in garb, 
with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his mouth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is Edgar&rsquo;s legal nephew,&rsquo; I 
reflected&mdash;&lsquo;mine in a manner; I must shake hands, 
and&mdash;yes&mdash;I must kiss him.&nbsp; It is right to 
establish a good understanding at the beginning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, 
said&mdash;&lsquo;How do you do, my dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?&rsquo; was my next
essay at conversation.</p>
<p>An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not 
&lsquo;frame off&rsquo; rewarded my perseverance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey, Throttler, lad!&rsquo; whispered the little 
wretch, rousing a half-bred bull-dog from its lair in a 
corner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, wilt thou be ganging?&rsquo; he asked 
authoritatively.</p>
<p>Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the 
threshold to wait till the others should enter.&nbsp; Mr. 
Heathcliff was nowhere visible; and Joseph, whom I followed to 
the stables, and requested to accompany me in, after staring and 
muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and 
replied&mdash;&lsquo;Mim! mim! mim!&nbsp; Did iver Christian body
hear aught like it?&nbsp; Mincing un&rsquo; munching!&nbsp; How 
can I tell whet ye say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, I wish you to come with me into the 
house!&rsquo; I cried, thinking him deaf, yet highly disgusted at
his rudeness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;None o&rsquo; me!&nbsp; I getten summut else to 
do,&rsquo; he answered, and continued his work; moving his 
lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and countenance 
(the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I&rsquo;m 
sure, as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.</p>
<p>I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another 
door, at which I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more
civil servant might show himself.&nbsp; After a short suspense, 
it was opened by a tall, gaunt man, without neckerchief, and 
otherwise extremely slovenly; his features were lost in masses of
shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders; and <i>his</i> eyes, too,
were like a ghostly Catherine&rsquo;s with all their beauty 
annihilated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s your business here?&rsquo; he demanded, 
grimly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name was Isabella Linton,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve seen me before, sir.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m lately 
married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here&mdash;I 
suppose, by your permission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he come back, then?&rsquo; asked the hermit, glaring
like a hungry wolf.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;we came just now,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;but 
he left me by the kitchen door; and when I would have gone in, 
your little boy played sentinel over the place, and frightened me
off by the help of a bull-dog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s well the hellish villain has kept his 
word!&rsquo; growled my future host, searching the darkness 
beyond me in expectation of discovering Heathcliff; and then he 
indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and threats of what he 
would have done had the &lsquo;fiend&rsquo; deceived him.</p>
<p>I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost 
inclined to slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could
execute that intention, he ordered me in, and shut and 
re-fastened the door.&nbsp; There was a great fire, and that was 
all the light in the huge apartment, whose floor had grown a 
uniform grey; and the once brilliant pewter-dishes, which used to
attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar 
obscurity, created by tarnish and dust.&nbsp; I inquired whether 
I might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom!&nbsp; Mr. 
Earnshaw vouchsafed no answer.&nbsp; He walked up and down, with 
his hands in his pockets, apparently quite forgetting my 
presence; and his abstraction was evidently so deep, and his 
whole aspect so misanthropical, that I shrank from disturbing him
again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling 
particularly cheerless, seated in worse than solitude on that 
inhospitable hearth, and remembering that four miles distant lay 
my delightful home, containing the only people I loved on earth; 
and there might as well be the Atlantic to part us, instead of 
those four miles: I could not overpass them!&nbsp; I questioned 
with myself&mdash;where must I turn for comfort? and&mdash;mind 
you don&rsquo;t tell Edgar, or Catherine&mdash;above every sorrow
beside, this rose pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who 
could or would be my ally against Heathcliff!&nbsp; I had sought 
shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost gladly, because I was 
secured by that arrangement from living alone with him; but he 
knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not fear their
intermeddling.</p>
<p>I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and 
nine, and still my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on 
his breast, and perfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter 
ejaculation forced itself out at intervals.&nbsp; I listened to 
detect a woman&rsquo;s voice in the house, and filled the interim
with wild regrets and dismal anticipations, which, at last, spoke
audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping.&nbsp; I was not 
aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in his
measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened 
surprise.&nbsp; Taking advantage of his recovered attention, I 
exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired with my journey, and I 
want to go to bed!&nbsp; Where is the maid-servant?&nbsp; Direct 
me to her, as she won&rsquo;t come to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have none,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;you must wait 
on yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where must I sleep, then?&rsquo; I sobbed; I was beyond
regarding self-respect, weighed down by fatigue and 
wretchedness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joseph will show you Heathcliff&rsquo;s chamber,&rsquo;
said he; &lsquo;open that door&mdash;he&rsquo;s in 
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in
the strangest tone&mdash;&lsquo;Be so good as to turn your lock, 
and draw your bolt&mdash;don&rsquo;t omit it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But why, Mr. 
Earnshaw?&rsquo;&nbsp; I did not relish the notion of 
deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here!&rsquo; he replied, pulling from his 
waistcoat a curiously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged 
spring knife attached to the barrel.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a 
great tempter to a desperate man, is it not?&nbsp; I cannot 
resist going up with this every night, and trying his door.&nbsp;
If once I find it open he&rsquo;s done for; I do it invariably, 
even though the minute before I have been recalling a hundred 
reasons that should make me refrain: it is some devil that urges 
me to thwart my own schemes by killing him.&nbsp; You fight 
against that devil for love as long as you may; when the time 
comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I surveyed the weapon inquisitively.&nbsp; A hideous notion 
struck me: how powerful I should be possessing such an 
instrument!&nbsp; I took it from his hand, and touched the 
blade.&nbsp; He looked astonished at the expression my face 
assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was 
covetousness.&nbsp; He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut 
the knife, and returned it to its concealment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you tell him,&rsquo; said 
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Put him on his guard, and watch for him.&nbsp; 
You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not shock 
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What has Heathcliff done to you?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;In what has he wronged you, to warrant this appalling 
hatred?&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wiser to bid him quit the 
house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; thundered Earnshaw; &lsquo;should he offer 
to leave me, he&rsquo;s a dead man: persuade him to attempt it, 
and you are a murderess!&nbsp; Am I to lose <i>all</i>, without a
chance of retrieval?&nbsp; Is Hareton to be a beggar?&nbsp; Oh, 
damnation!&nbsp; I <i>will</i> have it back; and I&rsquo;ll have 
<i>his</i> gold too; and then his blood; and hell shall have his 
soul!&nbsp; It will be ten times blacker with that guest than 
ever it was before!&rsquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve acquainted me, Ellen, with your old 
master&rsquo;s habits.&nbsp; He is clearly on the verge of 
madness: he was so last night at least.&nbsp; I shuddered to be 
near him, and thought on the servant&rsquo;s ill-bred moroseness 
as comparatively agreeable.&nbsp; He now recommenced his moody 
walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen.&nbsp;
Joseph was bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that 
swung above it; and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle 
close by.&nbsp; The contents of the pan began to boil, and he 
turned to plunge his hand into the bowl; I conjectured that this 
preparation was probably for our supper, and, being hungry, I 
resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out sharply, 
&lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> make the porridge!&rsquo;&nbsp; I 
removed the vessel out of his reach, and proceeded to take off my
hat and riding-habit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Earnshaw,&rsquo; I 
continued, &lsquo;directs me to wait on myself: I will.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m not going to act the lady among you, for fear I should 
starve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gooid Lord!&rsquo; he muttered, sitting down, and 
stroking his ribbed stockings from the knee to the ankle.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;If there&rsquo;s to be fresh ortherings&mdash;just when I 
getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev&rsquo; a 
<i>mistress</i> set o&rsquo;er my heead, it&rsquo;s like time to 
be flitting.&nbsp; I niver <i>did</i> think to see t&rsquo; day 
that I mud lave th&rsquo; owld place&mdash;but I doubt it&rsquo;s
nigh at hand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to 
work, sighing to remember a period when it would have been all 
merry fun; but compelled speedily to drive off the 
remembrance.&nbsp; It racked me to recall past happiness and the 
greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition, the 
quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the handfuls of meal
fell into the water.&nbsp; Joseph beheld my style of cookery with
growing indignation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thear!&rsquo; he ejaculated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hareton, thou
willn&rsquo;t sup thy porridge to-neeght; they&rsquo;ll be naught
but lumps as big as my neive.&nbsp; Thear, agean!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
fling in bowl un&rsquo; all, if I wer ye!&nbsp; There, pale 
t&rsquo; guilp off, un&rsquo; then ye&rsquo;ll hae done wi&rsquo;
&lsquo;t.&nbsp; Bang, bang.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a mercy t&rsquo; 
bothom isn&rsquo;t deaved out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the
basins; four had been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk 
was brought from the dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced 
drinking and spilling from the expansive lip.&nbsp; I 
expostulated, and desired that he should have his in a mug; 
affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so 
dirtily.&nbsp; The old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this 
nicety; assuring me, repeatedly, that &lsquo;the barn was every 
bit as good&rsquo; as I, &lsquo;and every bit as wollsome,&rsquo;
and wondering how I could fashion to be so conceited.&nbsp; 
Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and glowered up 
at me defyingly, as he slavered into the jug.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall have my supper in another room,&rsquo; I 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you no place you call a 
parlour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Parlour</i>!&rsquo; he echoed, sneeringly, 
&lsquo;<i>parlour</i>!&nbsp; Nay, we&rsquo;ve noa 
<i>parlours</i>.&nbsp; If yah dunnut loike wer company, 
there&rsquo;s maister&rsquo;s; un&rsquo; if yah dunnut loike 
maister, there&rsquo;s us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I shall go up-stairs,&rsquo; I answered; 
&lsquo;show me a chamber.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more 
milk.&nbsp; With great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded 
me in my ascent: we mounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now
and then, to look into the apartments we passed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a rahm,&rsquo; he said, at last, flinging 
back a cranky board on hinges.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s weel 
eneugh to ate a few porridge in.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a pack 
o&rsquo; corn i&rsquo; t&rsquo; corner, thear, meeterly clane; if
ye&rsquo;re feared o&rsquo; muckying yer grand silk cloes, spread
yer hankerchir o&rsquo; t&rsquo; top on&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;rahm&rsquo; was a kind of lumber-hole smelling 
strong of malt and grain; various sacks of which articles were 
piled around, leaving a wide, bare space in the middle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, man,&rsquo; I exclaimed, facing him angrily, 
&lsquo;this is not a place to sleep in.&nbsp; I wish to see my 
bed-room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Bed-rume</i>!&rsquo; he repeated, in a tone of 
mockery.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yah&rsquo;s see all t&rsquo; 
<i>bed-rumes</i> thear is&mdash;yon&rsquo;s mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the 
first in being more naked about the walls, and having a large, 
low, curtainless bed, with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one 
end.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do I want with yours?&rsquo; I retorted.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does not lodge at the top of the 
house, does he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s Maister <i>Hathecliff&rsquo;s</i> 
ye&rsquo;re wanting?&rsquo; cried he, as if making a new 
discovery.&nbsp; &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t ye ha&rsquo; said soa, at 
onst? un&rsquo; then, I mud ha&rsquo; telled ye, baht all this 
wark, that that&rsquo;s just one ye cannut see&mdash;he allas 
keeps it locked, un&rsquo; nob&rsquo;dy iver mells on&rsquo;t but
hisseln.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve a nice house, Joseph,&rsquo; I could not 
refrain from observing, &lsquo;and pleasant inmates; and I think 
the concentrated essence of all the madness in the world took up 
its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with theirs!&nbsp;
However, that is not to the present purpose&mdash;there are other
rooms.&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake be quick, and let me settle 
somewhere!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly 
down the wooden steps, and halting, before an apartment which, 
from that halt and the superior quality of its furniture, I 
conjectured to be the best one.&nbsp; There was a carpet&mdash;a 
good one, but the pattern was obliterated by dust; a fireplace 
hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome oak-bedstead 
with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and 
modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the 
vallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the 
iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing 
the drapery to trail upon the floor.&nbsp; The chairs were also 
damaged, many of them severely; and deep indentations deformed 
the panels of the walls.&nbsp; I was endeavouring to gather 
resolution for entering and taking possession, when my fool of a 
guide announced,&mdash;&lsquo;This here is t&rsquo; 
maister&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; My supper by this time was cold, my
appetite gone, and my patience exhausted.&nbsp; I insisted on 
being provided instantly with a place of refuge, and means of 
repose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whear the divil?&rsquo; began the religious 
elder.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Lord bless us!&nbsp; The Lord forgie 
us!&nbsp; Whear the <i>hell</i> wold ye gang? ye marred, 
wearisome nowt!&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ve seen all but Hareton&rsquo;s 
bit of a cham&rsquo;er.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not another hoile to 
lig down in i&rsquo; th&rsquo; hahse!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the 
ground; and then seated myself at the stairs&rsquo;-head, hid my 
face in my hands, and cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ech! ech!&rsquo; exclaimed Joseph.&nbsp; &lsquo;Weel 
done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss Cathy!&nbsp; Howsiver, t&rsquo;
maister sall just tum&rsquo;le o&rsquo;er them brooken pots; 
un&rsquo; then we&rsquo;s hear summut; we&rsquo;s hear how 
it&rsquo;s to be.&nbsp; Gooid-for-naught madling! ye desarve 
pining fro&rsquo; this to Churstmas, flinging t&rsquo; precious 
gifts o&rsquo;God under fooit i&rsquo; yer flaysome rages!&nbsp; 
But I&rsquo;m mista&rsquo;en if ye shew yer sperrit lang.&nbsp; 
Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye?&nbsp; I nobbut 
wish he may catch ye i&rsquo; that plisky.&nbsp; I nobbut wish he
may.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the 
candle with him; and I remained in the dark.&nbsp; The period of 
reflection succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the
necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath, and 
bestirring myself to remove its effects.&nbsp; An unexpected aid 
presently appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I now 
recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its 
whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr. 
Hindley.&nbsp; I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against 
mine by way of salute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; 
while I groped from step to step, collecting the shattered 
earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk from the banister 
with my pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp; Our labours were scarcely over
when I heard Earnshaw&rsquo;s tread in the passage; my assistant 
tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the 
nearest doorway.&nbsp; The dog&rsquo;s endeavour to avoid him was
unsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter down-stairs, and a 
prolonged, piteous yelping.&nbsp; I had better luck: he passed 
on, entered his chamber, and shut the door.&nbsp; Directly after 
Joseph came up with Hareton, to put him to bed.&nbsp; I had found
shelter in Hareton&rsquo;s room, and the old man, on seeing me, 
said,&mdash;&lsquo;They&rsquo;s rahm for boath ye un&rsquo; yer 
pride, now, I sud think i&rsquo; the hahse.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 
empty; ye may hev&rsquo; it all to yerseln, un&rsquo; Him as 
allus maks a third, i&rsquo; sich ill company!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute
I flung myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and 
slept.&nbsp; My slumber was deep and sweet, though over far too 
soon.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he had just come in, and 
demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing there?&nbsp; I 
told him the cause of my staying up so late&mdash;that he had the
key of our room in his pocket.&nbsp; The adjective <i>our</i> 
gave mortal offence.&nbsp; He swore it was not, nor ever should 
be, mine; and he&rsquo;d&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll not repeat his 
language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious and 
unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence!&nbsp; I sometimes 
wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I 
assure you, a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror 
in me equal to that which he wakens.&nbsp; He told me of 
Catherine&rsquo;s illness, and accused my brother of causing it 
promising that I should be Edgar&rsquo;s proxy in suffering, till
he could get hold of him.</p>
<p>I do hate him&mdash;I am wretched&mdash;I have been a 
fool!&nbsp; Beware of uttering one breath of this to any one at 
the Grange.&nbsp; I shall expect you every day&mdash;don&rsquo;t 
disappoint me!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isabella</span>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, 
and informed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and 
sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s 
situation, and her ardent desire to see him; with a wish that he 
would transmit to her, as early as possible, some token of 
forgiveness by me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgiveness!&rsquo; said Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have 
nothing to forgive her, Ellen.&nbsp; You may call at Wuthering 
Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I am not angry,
but I&rsquo;m sorry to have lost her; especially as I can never 
think she&rsquo;ll be happy.&nbsp; It is out of the question my 
going to see her, however: we are eternally divided; and should 
she really wish to oblige me, let her persuade the villain she 
has married to leave the country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you won&rsquo;t write her a little note, 
sir?&rsquo; I asked, imploringly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is 
needless.&nbsp; My communication with Heathcliff&rsquo;s family 
shall be as sparing as his with mine.&nbsp; It shall not 
exist!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Edgar&rsquo;s coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all 
the way from the Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart
into what he said, when I repeated it; and how to soften his 
refusal of even a few lines to console Isabella.&nbsp; I daresay 
she had been on the watch for me since morning: I saw her looking
through the lattice as I came up the garden causeway, and I 
nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being 
observed.&nbsp; I entered without knocking.&nbsp; There never was
such a dreary, dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house 
presented!&nbsp; I must confess, that if I had been in the young 
lady&rsquo;s place, I would, at least, have swept the hearth, and
wiped the tables with a duster.&nbsp; But she already partook of 
the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her.&nbsp; Her 
pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks 
hanging lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her 
head.&nbsp; Probably she had not touched her dress since yester 
evening.&nbsp; Hindley was not there.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff sat at
a table, turning over some papers in his pocket-book; but he rose
when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite friendly, and offered 
me a chair.&nbsp; He was the only thing there that seemed decent;
and I thought he never looked better.&nbsp; So much had 
circumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly 
have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife
as a thorough little slattern!&nbsp; She came forward eagerly to 
greet me, and held out one hand to take the expected 
letter.&nbsp; I shook my head.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t 
understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I went
to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her 
directly what I had brought.&nbsp; Heathcliff guessed the meaning
of her manoeuvres, and said&mdash;&lsquo;If you have got anything
for Isabella (as no doubt you have, Nelly), give it to her.&nbsp;
You needn&rsquo;t make a secret of it: we have no secrets between
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I have nothing,&rsquo; I replied, thinking it best 
to speak the truth at once.&nbsp; &lsquo;My master bid me tell 
his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit 
from him at present.&nbsp; He sends his love, ma&rsquo;am, and 
his wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you 
have occasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household
and the household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing
could come of keeping it up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Heathcliff&rsquo;s lip quivered slightly, and she 
returned to her seat in the window.&nbsp; Her husband took his 
stand on the hearthstone, near me, and began to put questions 
concerning Catherine.&nbsp; I told him as much as I thought 
proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by 
cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its 
origin.&nbsp; I blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all 
on herself; and ended by hoping that he would follow Mr. 
Linton&rsquo;s example and avoid future interference with his 
family, for good or evil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,&rsquo; I said; 
&lsquo;she&rsquo;ll never be like she was, but her life is 
spared; and if you really have a regard for her, you&rsquo;ll 
shun crossing her way again: nay, you&rsquo;ll move out of this 
country entirely; and that you may not regret it, I&rsquo;ll 
inform you Catherine Linton is as different now from your old 
friend Catherine Earnshaw, as that young lady is different from 
me.&nbsp; Her appearance is changed greatly, her character much 
more so; and the person who is compelled, of necessity, to be her
companion, will only sustain his affection hereafter by the 
remembrance of what she once was, by common humanity, and a sense
of duty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is quite possible,&rsquo; remarked Heathcliff, 
forcing himself to seem calm: &lsquo;quite possible that your 
master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of 
duty to fall back upon.&nbsp; But do you imagine that I shall 
leave Catherine to his <i>duty</i> and <i>humanity</i>? and can 
you compare my feelings respecting Catherine to his?&nbsp; Before
you leave this house, I must exact a promise from you that 
you&rsquo;ll get me an interview with her: consent, or refuse, I 
<i>will</i> see her!&nbsp; What do you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, Mr. Heathcliff,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;you 
must not: you never shall, through my means.&nbsp; Another 
encounter between you and the master would kill her 
altogether.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With your aid that may be avoided,&rsquo; he continued;
&lsquo;and should there be danger of such an event&mdash;should 
he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her 
existence&mdash;why, I think I shall be justified in going to 
extremes!&nbsp; I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me 
whether Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear 
that she would restrains me.&nbsp; And there you see the 
distinction between our feelings: had he been in my place, and I 
in his, though I hated him with a hatred that turned my life to 
gall, I never would have raised a hand against him.&nbsp; You may
look incredulous, if you please!&nbsp; I never would have 
banished him from her society as long as she desired his.&nbsp; 
The moment her regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, 
and drunk his blood!&nbsp; But, till then&mdash;if you 
don&rsquo;t believe me, you don&rsquo;t know me&mdash;till then, 
I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his
head!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; I interrupted, &lsquo;you have no 
scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect 
restoration, by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now, when
she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in a new tumult 
of discord and distress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?&rsquo; he 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Nelly! you know she has not!&nbsp; You 
know as well as I do, that for every thought she spends on Linton
she spends a thousand on me!&nbsp; At a most miserable period of 
my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return 
to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance 
could make me admit the horrible idea again.&nbsp; And then, 
Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that 
ever I dreamt.&nbsp; Two words would comprehend my 
future&mdash;<i>death</i> and <i>hell</i>: existence, after 
losing her, would be hell.&nbsp; Yet I was a fool to fancy for a 
moment that she valued Edgar Linton&rsquo;s attachment more than 
mine.&nbsp; If he loved with all the powers of his puny being, he
couldn&rsquo;t love as much in eighty years as I could in a 
day.&nbsp; And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea 
could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole 
affection be monopolised by him.&nbsp; Tush!&nbsp; He is scarcely
a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her horse.&nbsp; It is 
not in him to be loved like me: how can she love in him what he 
has not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any 
two people can be,&rsquo; cried Isabella, with sudden 
vivacity.&nbsp; &lsquo;No one has a right to talk in that manner,
and I won&rsquo;t hear my brother depreciated in 
silence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn&rsquo;t 
he?&rsquo; observed Heathcliff, scornfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;He turns
you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not aware of what I suffer,&rsquo; she 
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell him that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been telling him something, then: you have 
written, have you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To say that I was married, I did write&mdash;you saw 
the note.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And nothing since?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change
of condition,&rsquo; I remarked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Somebody&rsquo;s 
love comes short in her case, obviously; whose, I may guess; but,
perhaps, I shouldn&rsquo;t say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should guess it was her own,&rsquo; said 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; &lsquo;She degenerates into a mere slut!&nbsp; 
She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.&nbsp; 
You&rsquo;d hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding 
she was weeping to go home.&nbsp; However, she&rsquo;ll suit this
house so much the better for not being over nice, and I&rsquo;ll 
take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; returned I, &lsquo;I hope 
you&rsquo;ll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is accustomed to be 
looked after and waited on; and that she has been brought up like
an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.&nbsp; You 
must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you 
must treat her kindly.&nbsp; Whatever be your notion of Mr. 
Edgar, you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong 
attachments, or she wouldn&rsquo;t have abandoned the elegancies,
and comforts, and friends of her former home, to fix contentedly,
in such a wilderness as this, with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She abandoned them under a delusion,&rsquo; he 
answered; &lsquo;picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting
unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion.&nbsp; I can 
hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so 
obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my 
character and acting on the false impressions she 
cherished.&nbsp; But, at last, I think she begins to know me: I 
don&rsquo;t perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked 
me at first; and the senseless incapability of discerning that I 
was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her infatuation and 
herself.&nbsp; It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to 
discover that I did not love her.&nbsp; I believed, at one time, 
no lessons could teach her that!&nbsp; And yet it is poorly 
learnt; for this morning she announced, as a piece of appalling 
intelligence, that I had actually succeeded in making her hate 
me!&nbsp; A positive labour of Hercules, I assure you!&nbsp; If 
it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks.&nbsp; Can I trust 
your assertion, Isabella?&nbsp; Are you sure you hate me?&nbsp; 
If I let you alone for half a day, won&rsquo;t you come sighing 
and wheedling to me again?&nbsp; I daresay she would rather I had
seemed all tenderness before you: it wounds her vanity to have 
the truth exposed.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t care who knows that 
the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie 
about it.&nbsp; She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of 
deceitful softness.&nbsp; The first thing she saw me do, on 
coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her little dog; and when
she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a wish that I 
had the hanging of every being belonging to her, except one: 
possibly she took that exception for herself.&nbsp; But no 
brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate admiration 
of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury!&nbsp;
Now, was it not the depth of absurdity&mdash;of genuine idiotcy, 
for that pitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I 
could love her?&nbsp; Tell your master, Nelly, that I never, in 
all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is.&nbsp; She 
even disgraces the name of Linton; and I&rsquo;ve sometimes 
relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on what 
she could endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back!&nbsp;
But tell him, also, to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at
ease: that I keep strictly within the limits of the law.&nbsp; I 
have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest right 
to claim a separation; and, what&rsquo;s more, she&rsquo;d thank 
nobody for dividing us.&nbsp; If she desired to go, she might: 
the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be 
derived from tormenting her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Heathcliff,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;this is the talk 
of a madman; your wife, most likely, is convinced you are mad; 
and, for that reason, she has borne with you hitherto: but now 
that you say she may go, she&rsquo;ll doubtless avail herself of 
the permission.&nbsp; You are not so bewitched, ma&rsquo;am, are 
you, as to remain with him of your own accord?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care, Ellen!&rsquo; answered Isabella, her eyes 
sparkling irefully; there was no misdoubting by their expression 
the full success of her partner&rsquo;s endeavours to make 
himself detested.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t put faith in a single 
word he speaks.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a lying fiend! a monster, and 
not a human being!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been told I might leave him 
before; and I&rsquo;ve made the attempt, but I dare not repeat 
it!&nbsp; Only, Ellen, promise you&rsquo;ll not mention a 
syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or 
Catherine.&nbsp; Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke 
Edgar to desperation: he says he has married me on purpose to 
obtain power over him; and he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t obtain 
it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll die first!&nbsp; I just hope, I pray, that he
may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me!&nbsp; The single 
pleasure I can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&mdash;that will do for the present!&rsquo; said 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you are called upon in a court of 
law, you&rsquo;ll remember her language, Nelly!&nbsp; And take a 
good look at that countenance: she&rsquo;s near the point which 
would suit me.&nbsp; No; you&rsquo;re not fit to be your own 
guardian, Isabella, now; and I, being your legal protector, must 
retain you in my custody, however distasteful the obligation may 
be.&nbsp; Go up-stairs; I have something to say to Ellen Dean in 
private.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not the way: up-stairs, I tell 
you!&nbsp; Why, this is the road upstairs, child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned 
muttering&mdash;&lsquo;I have no pity!&nbsp; I have no 
pity!&nbsp; The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to crush 
out their entrails!&nbsp; It is a moral teething; and I grind 
with greater energy in proportion to the increase of 
pain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you understand what the word pity means?&rsquo; I 
said, hastening to resume my bonnet.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you ever 
feel a touch of it in your life?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put that down!&rsquo; he interrupted, perceiving my 
intention to depart.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are not going yet.&nbsp; 
Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or compel you to aid
me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine, and that 
without delay.&nbsp; I swear that I meditate no harm: I 
don&rsquo;t desire to cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or 
insult Mr. Linton; I only wish to hear from herself how she is, 
and why she has been ill; and to ask if anything that I could do 
would be of use to her.&nbsp; Last night I was in the Grange 
garden six hours, and I&rsquo;ll return there to-night; and every
night I&rsquo;ll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an 
opportunity of entering.&nbsp; If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall 
not hesitate to knock him down, and give him enough to insure his
quiescence while I stay.&nbsp; If his servants oppose me, I shall
threaten them off with these pistols.&nbsp; But wouldn&rsquo;t it
be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their 
master?&nbsp; And you could do it so easily.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d warn
you when I came, and then you might let me in unobserved, as soon
as she was alone, and watch till I departed, your conscience 
quite calm: you would be hindering mischief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I protested against playing that treacherous part in my 
employer&rsquo;s house: and, besides, I urged the cruelty and 
selfishness of his destroying Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s tranquillity 
for his satisfaction.&nbsp; &lsquo;The commonest occurrence 
startles her painfully,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s 
all nerves, and she couldn&rsquo;t bear the surprise, I&rsquo;m 
positive.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t persist, sir! or else I shall be 
obliged to inform my master of your designs; and he&rsquo;ll take
measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such 
unwarrantable intrusions!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that case I&rsquo;ll take measures to secure you, 
woman!&rsquo; exclaimed Heathcliff; &lsquo;you shall not leave 
Wuthering Heights till to-morrow morning.&nbsp; It is a foolish 
story to assert that Catherine could not bear to see me; and as 
to surprising her, I don&rsquo;t desire it: you must prepare 
her&mdash;ask her if I may come.&nbsp; You say she never mentions
my name, and that I am never mentioned to her.&nbsp; To whom 
should she mention me if I am a forbidden topic in the 
house?&nbsp; She thinks you are all spies for her husband.&nbsp; 
Oh, I&rsquo;ve no doubt she&rsquo;s in hell among you!&nbsp; I 
guess by her silence, as much as anything, what she feels.&nbsp; 
You say she is often restless, and anxious-looking: is that a 
proof of tranquillity?&nbsp; You talk of her mind being 
unsettled.&nbsp; How the devil could it be otherwise in her 
frightful isolation?&nbsp; And that insipid, paltry creature 
attending her from <i>duty</i> and <i>humanity</i>!&nbsp; From 
<i>pity</i> and <i>charity</i>!&nbsp; He might as well plant an 
oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he can 
restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares?&nbsp; Let
us settle it at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my 
way to Catherine over Linton and his footman?&nbsp; Or will you 
be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I 
request?&nbsp; Decide! because there is no reason for my 
lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn 
ill-nature!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly 
refused him fifty times; but in the long run he forced me to an 
agreement.&nbsp; I engaged to carry a letter from him to my 
mistress; and should she consent, I promised to let him have 
intelligence of Linton&rsquo;s next absence from home, when he 
might come, and get in as he was able: I wouldn&rsquo;t be there,
and my fellow-servants should be equally out of the way.&nbsp; 
Was it right or wrong?&nbsp; I fear it was wrong, though 
expedient.&nbsp; I thought I prevented another explosion by my 
compliance; and I thought, too, it might create a favourable 
crisis in Catherine&rsquo;s mental illness: and then I remembered
Mr. Edgar&rsquo;s stern rebuke of my carrying tales; and I tried 
to smooth away all disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with
frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so
harsh an appellation, should be the last.&nbsp; Notwithstanding, 
my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither; and many 
misgivings I had, ere I could prevail on myself to put the 
missive into Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>But here is Kenneth; I&rsquo;ll go down, and tell him how much
better you are.&nbsp; My history is <i>dree</i>, as we say, and 
will serve to while away another morning.</p>
<p>Dree, and dreary!&nbsp; I reflected as the good woman 
descended to receive the doctor: and not exactly of the kind 
which I should have chosen to amuse me.&nbsp; But never 
mind!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs. 
Dean&rsquo;s bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the 
fascination that lurks in Catherine Heathcliff&rsquo;s brilliant 
eyes.&nbsp; I should be in a curious taking if I surrendered my 
heart to that young person, and the daughter turned out a second 
edition of the mother.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>Another week over&mdash;and I am so many days nearer health, 
and spring!&nbsp; I have now heard all my neighbour&rsquo;s 
history, at different sittings, as the housekeeper could spare 
time from more important occupations.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll continue 
it in her own words, only a little condensed.&nbsp; She is, on 
the whole, a very fair narrator, and I don&rsquo;t think I could 
improve her style.</p>
<p>In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the 
Heights, I knew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was
about the place; and I shunned going out, because I still carried
his letter in my pocket, and didn&rsquo;t want to be threatened 
or teased any more.&nbsp; I had made up my mind not to give it 
till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how its 
receipt would affect Catherine.&nbsp; The consequence was, that 
it did not reach her before the lapse of three days.&nbsp; The 
fourth was Sunday, and I brought it into her room after the 
family were gone to church.&nbsp; There was a manservant left to 
keep the house with me, and we generally made a practice of 
locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that 
occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them 
wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be 
coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much 
for some oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a 
few, to be paid for on the morrow.&nbsp; He departed, and I went 
up-stairs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl 
over her shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as 
usual.&nbsp; Her thick, long hair had been partly removed at the 
beginning of her illness, and now she wore it simply combed in 
its natural tresses over her temples and neck.&nbsp; Her 
appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she 
was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.&nbsp; The 
flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy 
softness; they no longer gave the impression of looking at the 
objects around her: they appeared always to gaze beyond, and far 
beyond&mdash;you would have said out of this world.&nbsp; Then, 
the paleness of her face&mdash;its haggard aspect having vanished
as she recovered flesh&mdash;and the peculiar expression arising 
from her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their 
causes, added to the touching interest which she awakened; 
and&mdash;invariably to me, I know, and to any person who saw 
her, I should think&mdash;refuted more tangible proofs of 
convalescence, and stamped her as one doomed to decay.</p>
<p>A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely 
perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals.&nbsp; I 
believe Linton had laid it there: for she never endeavoured to 
divert herself with reading, or occupation of any kind, and he 
would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to 
some subject which had formerly been her amusement.&nbsp; She was
conscious of his aim, and in her better moods endured his efforts
placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then 
suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the 
saddest of smiles and kisses.&nbsp; At other times, she would 
turn petulantly away, and hide her face in her hands, or even 
push him off angrily; and then he took care to let her alone, for
he was certain of doing no good.</p>
<p>Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, 
mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the 
ear.&nbsp; It was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of
the summer foliage, which drowned that music about the Grange 
when the trees were in leaf.&nbsp; At Wuthering Heights it always
sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a season of 
steady rain.&nbsp; And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was 
thinking as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at 
all; but she had the vague, distant look I mentioned before, 
which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear 
or eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,&rsquo; I 
said, gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her 
knee.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must read it immediately, because it wants
an answer.&nbsp; Shall I break the seal?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered, without altering the direction 
of her eyes.&nbsp; I opened it&mdash;it was very short.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;read it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She 
drew away her hand, and let it fall.&nbsp; I replaced it in her 
lap, and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down; 
but that movement was so long delayed that at last I 
resumed&mdash;&lsquo;Must I read it, ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp; It is 
from Mr. Heathcliff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a 
struggle to arrange her ideas.&nbsp; She lifted the letter, and 
seemed to peruse it; and when she came to the signature she 
sighed: yet still I found she had not gathered its import, for, 
upon my desiring to hear her reply, she merely pointed to the 
name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning 
eagerness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he wishes to see you,&rsquo; said I, guessing her
need of an interpreter.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s in the garden by 
this time, and impatient to know what answer I shall 
bring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass 
beneath raise its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing 
them back, announce, by a wag of the tail, that some one 
approached whom it did not consider a stranger.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton
bent forward, and listened breathlessly.&nbsp; The minute after a
step traversed the hall; the open house was too tempting for 
Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely he supposed that I 
was inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his
own audacity.&nbsp; With straining eagerness Catherine gazed 
towards the entrance of her chamber.&nbsp; He did not hit the 
right room directly: she motioned me to admit him, but he found 
it out ere I could reach the door, and in a stride or two was at 
her side, and had her grasped in his arms.</p>
<p>He neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, 
during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in 
his life before, I daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him 
first, and I plainly saw that he could hardly bear, for downright
agony, to look into her face!&nbsp; The same conviction had 
stricken him as me, from the instant he beheld her, that there 
was no prospect of ultimate recovery there&mdash;she was fated, 
sure to die.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Cathy!&nbsp; Oh, my life! how can I bear it?&rsquo;
was the first sentence he uttered, in a tone that did not seek to
disguise his despair.&nbsp; And now he stared at her so earnestly
that I thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears 
into his eyes; but they burned with anguish: they did not 
melt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What now?&rsquo; said Catherine, leaning back, and 
returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow: her humour was a
mere vane for constantly varying caprices.&nbsp; &lsquo;You and 
Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff!&nbsp; And you both come 
to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be 
pitied!&nbsp; I shall not pity you, not I.&nbsp; You have killed 
me&mdash;and thriven on it, I think.&nbsp; How strong you 
are!&nbsp; How many years do you mean to live after I am 
gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted 
to rise, but she seized his hair, and kept him down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could hold you,&rsquo; she continued, 
bitterly, &lsquo;till we were both dead!&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t 
care what you suffered.&nbsp; I care nothing for your 
sufferings.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t you suffer?&nbsp; I 
do!&nbsp; Will you forget me?&nbsp; Will you be happy when I am 
in the earth?&nbsp; Will you say twenty years hence, 
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the grave of Catherine Earnshaw?&nbsp; I 
loved her long ago, and was wretched to lose her; but it is 
past.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve loved many others since: my children are 
dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not rejoice 
that I are going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave 
them!&rdquo;&nbsp; Will you say so, Heathcliff?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t torture me till I&rsquo;m as mad as 
yourself,&rsquo; cried he, wrenching his head free, and grinding 
his teeth.</p>
<p>The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful 
picture.&nbsp; Well might Catherine deem that heaven would be a 
land of exile to her, unless with her mortal body she cast away 
her moral character also.&nbsp; Her present countenance had a 
wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless lip and 
scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed fingers a 
portion of the locks she had been grasping.&nbsp; As to her 
companion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken her 
arm with the other; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness
to the requirements of her condition, that on his letting go I 
saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless 
skin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you possessed with a devil,&rsquo; he pursued, 
savagely, &lsquo;to talk in that manner to me when you are 
dying?&nbsp; Do you reflect that all those words will be branded 
in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have left 
me?&nbsp; You know you lie to say I have killed you: and, 
Catherine, you know that I could as soon forget you as my 
existence!&nbsp; Is it not sufficient for your infernal 
selfishness, that while you are at peace I shall writhe in the 
torments of hell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not be at peace,&rsquo; moaned Catherine, 
recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent, unequal 
throbbing of her heart, which beat visibly and audibly under this
excess of agitation.&nbsp; She said nothing further till the 
paroxysm was over; then she continued, more kindly&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not wishing you greater torment than I have, 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; I only wish us never to be parted: and should a
word of mine distress you hereafter, think I feel the same 
distress underground, and for my own sake, forgive me!&nbsp; Come
here and kneel down again!&nbsp; You never harmed me in your 
life.&nbsp; Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to 
remember than my harsh words!&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you come here 
again?&nbsp; Do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but 
not so far as to let her see his face, which was livid with 
emotion.&nbsp; She bent round to look at him; he would not permit
it: turning abruptly, he walked to the fireplace, where he stood,
silent, with his back towards us.&nbsp; Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s 
glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke a new 
sentiment in her.&nbsp; After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she 
resumed; addressing me in accents of indignant 
disappointment:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to 
keep me out of the grave.&nbsp; <i>That</i> is how I&rsquo;m 
loved!&nbsp; Well, never mind.&nbsp; That is not <i>my</i> 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: 
he&rsquo;s in my soul.&nbsp; And,&rsquo; added she musingly, 
&lsquo;the thing that irks me most is this shattered prison, 
after all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tired of being enclosed here.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be 
always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for
it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and 
in it.&nbsp; Nelly, you think you are better and more fortunate 
than I; in full health and strength: you are sorry for 
me&mdash;very soon that will be altered.&nbsp; I shall be sorry 
for <i>you</i>.&nbsp; I shall be incomparably beyond and above 
you all.&nbsp; I <i>wonder</i> he won&rsquo;t be near 
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; She went on to herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought 
he wished it.&nbsp; Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen 
now.&nbsp; Do come to me, Heathcliff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of 
the chair.&nbsp; At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking
absolutely desperate.&nbsp; His eyes, wide and wet, at last 
flashed fiercely on her; his breast heaved convulsively.&nbsp; An
instant they held asunder, and then how they met I hardly saw, 
but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her, and they were 
locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress would never
be released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly 
insensible.&nbsp; He flung himself into the nearest seat, and on 
my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he 
gnashed at me, and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him
with greedy jealousy.&nbsp; I did not feel as if I were in the 
company of a creature of my own species: it appeared that he 
would not understand, though I spoke to him; so I stood off, and 
held my tongue, in great perplexity.</p>
<p>A movement of Catherine&rsquo;s relieved me a little 
presently: she put up her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her 
cheek to his as he held her; while he, in return, covering her 
with frantic caresses, said wildly&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You teach me now how cruel you&rsquo;ve 
been&mdash;cruel and false.&nbsp; <i>Why</i> did you despise 
me?&nbsp; <i>Why</i> did you betray your own heart, Cathy?&nbsp; 
I have not one word of comfort.&nbsp; You deserve this.&nbsp; You
have killed yourself.&nbsp; Yes, you may kiss me, and cry; and 
wring out my kisses and tears: they&rsquo;ll blight 
you&mdash;they&rsquo;ll damn you.&nbsp; You loved me&mdash;then 
what <i>right</i> had you to leave me?&nbsp; What 
right&mdash;answer me&mdash;for the poor fancy you felt for 
Linton?&nbsp; Because misery and degradation, and death, and 
nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, 
<i>you</i>, of your own will, did it.&nbsp; I have not broken 
your heart&mdash;<i>you</i> have broken it; and in breaking it, 
you have broken mine.&nbsp; So much the worse for me that I am 
strong.&nbsp; Do I want to live?&nbsp; What kind of living will 
it be when you&mdash;oh, God! would <i>you</i> like to live with 
your soul in the grave?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me alone.&nbsp; Let me alone,&rsquo; sobbed 
Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I&rsquo;ve done wrong, I&rsquo;m dying
for it.&nbsp; It is enough!&nbsp; You left me too: but I 
won&rsquo;t upbraid you!&nbsp; I forgive you.&nbsp; Forgive 
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and 
feel those wasted hands,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Kiss me
again; and don&rsquo;t let me see your eyes!&nbsp; I forgive what
you have done to me.&nbsp; I love <i>my</i> murderer&mdash;but 
<i>yours</i>!&nbsp; How can I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were silent-their faces hid against each other, and 
washed by each other&rsquo;s tears.&nbsp; At least, I suppose the
weeping was on both sides; as it seemed Heathcliff could weep on 
a great occasion like this.</p>
<p>I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore 
fast away, the man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, 
and I could distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the 
valley, a concourse thickening outside Gimmerton chapel 
porch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Service is over,&rsquo; I announced.&nbsp; &lsquo;My 
master will be here in half an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she
never moved.</p>
<p>Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the 
road towards the kitchen wing.&nbsp; Mr. Linton was not far 
behind; he opened the gate himself and sauntered slowly up, 
probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as 
summer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now he is here,&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;For 
heaven&rsquo;s sake, hurry down!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll not meet any 
one on the front stairs.&nbsp; Do be quick; and stay among the 
trees till he is fairly in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must go, Cathy,&rsquo; said Heathcliff, seeking to 
extricate himself from his companion&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But if I live, I&rsquo;ll see you again before you are 
asleep.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t stray five yards from your 
window.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not go!&rsquo; she answered, holding him as 
firmly as her strength allowed.&nbsp; &lsquo;You <i>shall</i> 
not, I tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For one hour,&rsquo; he pleaded earnestly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not for one minute,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>must</i>&mdash;Linton will be up 
immediately,&rsquo; persisted the alarmed intruder.</p>
<p>He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the 
act&mdash;she clung fast, gasping: there was mad resolution in 
her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; she shrieked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, 
don&rsquo;t go.&nbsp; It is the last time!&nbsp; Edgar will not 
hurt us.&nbsp; Heathcliff, I shall die!&nbsp; I shall 
die!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn the fool!&nbsp; There he is,&rsquo; cried 
Heathcliff, sinking back into his seat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hush, my 
darling!&nbsp; Hush, hush, Catherine!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll 
stay.&nbsp; If he shot me so, I&rsquo;d expire with a blessing on
my lips.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And there they were fast again.&nbsp; I heard my master 
mounting the stairs&mdash;the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I 
was horrified.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you going to listen to her ravings?&rsquo; I said, 
passionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;She does not know what she says.&nbsp;
Will you ruin her, because she has not wit to help herself?&nbsp;
Get up!&nbsp; You could be free instantly.&nbsp; That is the most
diabolical deed that ever you did.&nbsp; We are all done 
for&mdash;master, mistress, and servant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his 
step at the noise.&nbsp; In the midst of my agitation, I was 
sincerely glad to observe that Catherine&rsquo;s arms had fallen 
relaxed, and her head hung down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s fainted, or dead,&rsquo; I thought: 
&lsquo;so much the better.&nbsp; Far better that she should be 
dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to all about 
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment
and rage.&nbsp; What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the 
other stopped all demonstrations, at once, by placing the 
lifeless-looking form in his arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look there!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Unless you be 
a fiend, help her first&mdash;then you shall speak to 
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He walked into the parlour, and sat down.&nbsp; Mr. Linton 
summoned me, and with great difficulty, and after resorting to 
many means, we managed to restore her to sensation; but she was 
all bewildered; she sighed, and moaned, and knew nobody.&nbsp; 
Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her hated friend.&nbsp; I 
did not.&nbsp; I went, at the earliest opportunity, and besought 
him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he should
hear from me in the morning how she passed the night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not refuse to go out of doors,&rsquo; he 
answered; &lsquo;but I shall stay in the garden: and, Nelly, mind
you keep your word to-morrow.&nbsp; I shall be under those 
larch-trees.&nbsp; Mind! or I pay another visit, whether Linton 
be in or not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the 
chamber, and, ascertaining that what I stated was apparently 
true, delivered the house of his luckless presence.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>About twelve o&rsquo;clock that night was born the Catherine 
you saw at Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months&rsquo; child; 
and two hours after the mother died, having never recovered 
sufficient consciousness to miss Heathcliff, or know Edgar.&nbsp;
The latter&rsquo;s distraction at his bereavement is a subject 
too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how deep the
sorrow sunk.&nbsp; A great addition, in my eyes, was his being 
left without an heir.&nbsp; I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the 
feeble orphan; and I mentally abused old Linton for (what was 
only natural partiality) the securing his estate to his own 
daughter, instead of his son&rsquo;s.&nbsp; An unwelcomed infant 
it was, poor thing!&nbsp; It might have wailed out of life, and 
nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of 
existence.&nbsp; We redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its 
beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be.</p>
<p>Next morning&mdash;bright and cheerful out of 
doors&mdash;stole softened in through the blinds of the silent 
room, and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow, 
tender glow.&nbsp; Edgar Linton had his head laid on the pillow, 
and his eyes shut.&nbsp; His young and fair features were almost 
as deathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as 
fixed: but <i>his</i> was the hush of exhausted anguish, and 
<i>hers</i> of perfect peace.&nbsp; Her brow smooth, her lids 
closed, her lips wearing the expression of a smile; no angel in 
heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.&nbsp; And I 
partook of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never 
in a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of 
Divine rest.&nbsp; I instinctively echoed the words she had 
uttered a few hours before: &lsquo;Incomparably beyond and above 
us all!&nbsp; Whether still on earth or now in heaven, her spirit
is at home with God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am 
seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of 
death, should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty 
with me.&nbsp; I see a repose that neither earth nor hell can 
break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless 
hereafter&mdash;the Eternity they have entered&mdash;where life 
is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy 
in its fulness.&nbsp; I noticed on that occasion how much 
selfishness there is even in a love like Mr. Linton&rsquo;s, when
he so regretted Catherine&rsquo;s blessed release!&nbsp; To be 
sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and impatient 
existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at 
last.&nbsp; One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but 
not then, in the presence of her corpse.&nbsp; It asserted its 
own tranquillity, which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its 
former inhabitant.</p>
<p>Do you believe such people are happy in the other world, 
sir?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d give a great deal to know.</p>
<p>I declined answering Mrs. Dean&rsquo;s question, which struck 
me as something heterodox.&nbsp; She proceeded:</p>
<p>Retracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no 
right to think she is; but we&rsquo;ll leave her with her 
Maker.</p>
<p>The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to
quit the room and steal out to the pure refreshing air.&nbsp; The
servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my 
protracted watch; in reality, my chief motive was seeing Mr. 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; If he had remained among the larches all night,
he would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange; unless, 
perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to 
Gimmerton.&nbsp; If he had come nearer, he would probably be 
aware, from the lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and 
shutting of the outer doors, that all was not right within.&nbsp;
I wished, yet feared, to find him.&nbsp; I felt the terrible news
must be told, and I longed to get it over; but how to do it I did
not know.&nbsp; He was there&mdash;at least, a few yards further 
in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat off, and his 
hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded 
branches, and fell pattering round him.&nbsp; He had been 
standing a long time in that position, for I saw a pair of ousels
passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him, busy in 
building their nest, and regarding his proximity no more than 
that of a piece of timber.&nbsp; They flew off at my approach, 
and he raised his eyes and spoke:&mdash;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s 
dead!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not waited for you to 
learn that.&nbsp; Put your handkerchief away&mdash;don&rsquo;t 
snivel before me.&nbsp; Damn you all! she wants none of your 
tears!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity 
creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or 
others.&nbsp; When I first looked into his face, I perceived that
he had got intelligence of the catastrophe; and a foolish notion 
struck me that his heart was quelled and he prayed, because his 
lips moved and his gaze was bent on the ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s dead!&rsquo; I answered, checking my 
sobs and drying my cheeks.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gone to heaven, I hope; 
where we may, every one, join her, if we take due warning and 
leave our evil ways to follow good!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did <i>she</i> take due warning, then?&rsquo; asked 
Heathcliff, attempting a sneer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did she die like a 
saint?&nbsp; Come, give me a true history of the event.&nbsp; How
did&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it;
and compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward
agony, defying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, 
ferocious stare.&nbsp; &lsquo;How did she die?&rsquo; he resumed,
at last&mdash;fain, notwithstanding his hardihood, to have a 
support behind him; for, after the struggle, he trembled, in 
spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor wretch!&rsquo; I thought; &lsquo;you have a heart 
and nerves the same as your brother men!&nbsp; Why should you be 
anxious to conceal them?&nbsp; Your pride cannot blind God!&nbsp;
You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of 
humiliation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quietly as a lamb!&rsquo; I answered, aloud.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;She drew a sigh, and stretched herself, like a child 
reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five minutes after I 
felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And&mdash;did she ever mention me?&rsquo; he asked, 
hesitating, as if he dreaded the answer to his question would 
introduce details that he could not bear to hear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from 
the time you left her,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;She lies with 
a sweet smile on her face; and her latest ideas wandered back to 
pleasant early days.&nbsp; Her life closed in a gentle 
dream&mdash;may she wake as kindly in the other world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May she wake in torment!&rsquo; he cried, with 
frightful vehemence, stamping his foot, and groaning in a sudden 
paroxysm of ungovernable passion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, she&rsquo;s a
liar to the end!&nbsp; Where is she?&nbsp; Not 
<i>there</i>&mdash;not in heaven&mdash;not 
perished&mdash;where?&nbsp; Oh! you said you cared nothing for my
sufferings!&nbsp; And I pray one prayer&mdash;I repeat it till my
tongue stiffens&mdash;Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as 
long as I am living; you said I killed you&mdash;haunt me, 
then!&nbsp; The murdered <i>do</i> haunt their murderers, I 
believe.&nbsp; I know that ghosts <i>have</i> wandered on 
earth.&nbsp; Be with me always&mdash;take any form&mdash;drive me
mad! only <i>do</i> not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot 
find you!&nbsp; Oh, God! it is unutterable!&nbsp; I <i>cannot</i>
live without my life!&nbsp; I <i>cannot</i> live without my 
soul!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up 
his eyes, howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being 
goaded to death with knives and spears.&nbsp; I observed several 
splashes of blood about the bark of the tree, and his hand and 
forehead were both stained; probably the scene I witnessed was a 
repetition of others acted during the night.&nbsp; It hardly 
moved my compassion&mdash;it appalled me: still, I felt reluctant
to quit him so.&nbsp; But the moment he recollected himself 
enough to notice me watching, he thundered a command for me to 
go, and I obeyed.&nbsp; He was beyond my skill to quiet or 
console!</p>
<p>Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s funeral was appointed to take place on the
Friday following her decease; and till then her coffin remained 
uncovered, and strewn with flowers and scented leaves, in the 
great drawing-room.&nbsp; Linton spent his days and nights there,
a sleepless guardian; and&mdash;a circumstance concealed from all
but me&mdash;Heathcliff spent his nights, at least, outside, 
equally a stranger to repose.&nbsp; I held no communication with 
him: still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could; 
and on the Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from 
sheer fatigue, had been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I 
went and opened one of the windows; moved by his perseverance to 
give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one
final adieu.&nbsp; He did not omit to avail himself of the 
opportunity, cautiously and briefly; too cautiously to betray his
presence by the slightest noise.&nbsp; Indeed, I shouldn&rsquo;t 
have discovered that he had been there, except for the 
disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse&rsquo;s face, and 
for observing on the floor a curl of light hair, fastened with a 
silver thread; which, on examination, I ascertained to have been 
taken from a locket hung round Catherine&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp; 
Heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents, 
replacing them by a black lock of his own.&nbsp; I twisted the 
two, and enclosed them together.</p>
<p>Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of 
his sister to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so
that, besides her husband, the mourners were wholly composed of 
tenants and servants.&nbsp; Isabella was not asked.</p>
<p>The place of Catherine&rsquo;s interment, to the surprise of 
the villagers, was neither in the chapel under the carved 
monument of the Lintons, nor yet by the tombs of her own 
relations, outside.&nbsp; It was dug on a green slope in a corner
of the kirk-yard, where the wall is so low that heath and 
bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and 
peat-mould almost buries it.&nbsp; Her husband lies in the same 
spot now; and they have each a simple headstone above, and a 
plain grey block at their feet, to mark the graves.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>That Friday made the last of our fine days for a month.&nbsp; 
In the evening the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to 
north-east, and brought rain first, and then sleet and 
snow.&nbsp; On the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had
been three weeks of summer: the primroses and crocuses were 
hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent, the young 
leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened.&nbsp; And 
dreary, and chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over!&nbsp; 
My master kept his room; I took possession of the lonely parlour,
converting it into a nursery: and there I was, sitting with the 
moaning doll of a child laid on my knee; rocking it to and fro, 
and watching, meanwhile, the still driving flakes build up the 
uncurtained window, when the door opened, and some person 
entered, out of breath and laughing!&nbsp; My anger was greater 
than my astonishment for a minute.&nbsp; I supposed it one of the
maids, and I cried&mdash;&lsquo;Have done!&nbsp; How dare you 
show your giddiness here; What would Mr. Linton say if he heard 
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse me!&rsquo; answered a familiar voice; &lsquo;but
I know Edgar is in bed, and I cannot stop myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and 
holding her hand to her side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!&rsquo;
she continued, after a pause; &lsquo;except where I&rsquo;ve 
flown.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t count the number of falls 
I&rsquo;ve had.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m aching all over!&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t be alarmed!&nbsp; There shall be an explanation as 
soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to step out 
and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a 
servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff.&nbsp; She certainly seemed 
in no laughing predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, 
dripping with snow and water; she was dressed in the girlish 
dress she commonly wore, befitting her age more than her 
position: a low frock with short sleeves, and nothing on either 
head or neck.&nbsp; The frock was of light silk, and clung to her
with wet, and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers; 
add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold 
prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and 
bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through 
fatigue; and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed 
when I had had leisure to examine her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear young lady,&rsquo; I exclaimed, 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stir nowhere, and hear nothing, till you have 
removed every article of your clothes, and put on dry things; and
certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so it is 
needless to order the carriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly I shall,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;walking or 
riding: yet I&rsquo;ve no objection to dress myself 
decently.&nbsp; And&mdash;ah, see how it flows down my neck 
now!&nbsp; The fire does make it smart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would
let me touch her; and not till after the coachman had been 
instructed to get ready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary
attire, did I obtain her consent for binding the wound and 
helping to change her garments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Ellen,&rsquo; she said, when my task was finished 
and she was seated in an easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of 
tea before her, &lsquo;you sit down opposite me, and put poor 
Catherine&rsquo;s baby away: I don&rsquo;t like to see it!&nbsp; 
You mustn&rsquo;t think I care little for Catherine, because I 
behaved so foolishly on entering: I&rsquo;ve cried, too, 
bitterly&mdash;yes, more than any one else has reason to 
cry.&nbsp; We parted unreconciled, you remember, and I 
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forgive myself.&nbsp; But, for all that, I 
was not going to sympathise with him&mdash;the brute beast!&nbsp;
Oh, give me the poker!&nbsp; This is the last thing of his I have
about me:&rsquo; she slipped the gold ring from her third finger,
and threw it on the floor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll smash 
it!&rsquo; she continued, striking it with childish spite, 
&lsquo;and then I&rsquo;ll burn it!&rsquo; and she took and 
dropped the misused article among the coals.&nbsp; &lsquo;There! 
he shall buy another, if he gets me back again.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d 
be capable of coming to seek me, to tease Edgar.&nbsp; I dare not
stay, lest that notion should possess his wicked head!&nbsp; And 
besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he?&nbsp; And I won&rsquo;t
come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him into more 
trouble.&nbsp; Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; 
though, if I had not learned he was out of the way, I&rsquo;d 
have halted at the kitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got 
you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to anywhere out of
the reach of my accursed&mdash;of that incarnate goblin!&nbsp; 
Ah, he was in such a fury!&nbsp; If he had caught me!&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s a pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I 
wouldn&rsquo;t have run till I&rsquo;d seen him all but 
demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t talk so fast, Miss!&rsquo; I 
interrupted; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll disorder the handkerchief I have
tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.&nbsp; Drink 
your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is 
sadly out of place under this roof, and in your 
condition!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An undeniable truth,&rsquo; she replied.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Listen to that child!&nbsp; It maintains a constant 
wail&mdash;send it out of my hearing for an hour; I 
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stay any longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant&rsquo;s care; 
and then I inquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering 
Heights in such an unlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as
she refused remaining with us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ought, and I wished to remain,&rsquo; answered she, 
&lsquo;to cheer Edgar and take care of the baby, for two things, 
and because the Grange is my right home.&nbsp; But I tell you he 
wouldn&rsquo;t let me!&nbsp; Do you think he could bear to see me
grow fat and merry&mdash;could bear to think that we were 
tranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort?&nbsp; Now, I 
have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to the 
point of its annoying him seriously to have me within ear-shot or
eyesight: I notice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of his
countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of 
hatred; partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes I 
have to feel that sentiment for him, and partly from original 
aversion.&nbsp; It is strong enough to make me feel pretty 
certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing I 
contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite 
away.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve recovered from my first desire to be 
killed by him: I&rsquo;d rather he&rsquo;d kill himself!&nbsp; He
has extinguished my love effectually, and so I&rsquo;m at my 
ease.&nbsp; I can recollect yet how I loved him; and can dimly 
imagine that I could still be loving him, if&mdash;no, no!&nbsp; 
Even if he had doted on me, the devilish nature would have 
revealed its existence somehow.&nbsp; Catherine had an awfully 
perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so 
well.&nbsp; Monster! would that he could be blotted out of 
creation, and out of my memory!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a human being,&rsquo; I 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be more charitable: there are worse men than 
he is yet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not a human being,&rsquo; she retorted; 
&lsquo;and he has no claim on my charity.&nbsp; I gave him my 
heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and flung it back to 
me.&nbsp; People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he has 
destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would 
not, though he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears
of blood for Catherine!&nbsp; No, indeed, indeed, I 
wouldn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;&nbsp; And here Isabella began to cry; but,
immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she 
recommenced.&nbsp; &lsquo;You asked, what has driven me to flight
at last?&nbsp; I was compelled to attempt it, because I had 
succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity.&nbsp; 
Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more 
coolness than knocking on the head.&nbsp; He was worked up to 
forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to 
murderous violence.&nbsp; I experienced pleasure in being able to
exasperate him: the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of 
self-preservation, so I fairly broke free; and if ever I come 
into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at 
the funeral.&nbsp; He kept himself sober for the 
purpose&mdash;tolerably sober: not going to bed mad at six 
o&rsquo;clock and getting up drunk at twelve.&nbsp; Consequently,
he rose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a 
dance; and instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or 
brandy by tumblerfuls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff&mdash;I shudder to name him! has been a 
stranger in the house from last Sunday till to-day.&nbsp; Whether
the angels have fed him, or his kin beneath, I cannot tell; but 
he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week.&nbsp; He has 
just come home at dawn, and gone up-stairs to his chamber; 
looking himself in&mdash;as if anybody dreamt of coveting his 
company!&nbsp; There he has continued, praying like a Methodist: 
only the deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes; and God, 
when addressed, was curiously confounded with his own black 
father!&nbsp; After concluding these precious orisons&mdash;and 
they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was 
strangled in his throat&mdash;he would be off again; always 
straight down to the Grange!&nbsp; I wonder Edgar did not send 
for a constable, and give him into custody!&nbsp; For me, grieved
as I was about Catherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding 
this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a 
holiday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I recovered spirits sufficient to bear Joseph&rsquo;s 
eternal lectures without weeping, and to move up and down the 
house less with the foot of a frightened thief than 
formerly.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t think that I should cry at 
anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable 
companions.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather sit with Hindley, and hear his
awful talk, than with &ldquo;t&rsquo; little maister&rdquo; and 
his staunch supporter, that odious old man!&nbsp; When Heathcliff
is in, I&rsquo;m often obliged to seek the kitchen and their 
society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he 
is not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair 
at one corner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw 
may occupy himself; and he does not interfere with my 
arrangements.&nbsp; He is quieter now than he used to be, if no 
one provokes him: more sullen and depressed, and less 
furious.&nbsp; Joseph affirms he&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;s an 
altered man: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved
&ldquo;so as by fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m puzzled to detect 
signs of the favourable change: but it is not my business.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books 
till late on towards twelve.&nbsp; It seemed so dismal to go 
up-stairs, with the wild snow blowing outside, and my thoughts 
continually reverting to the kirk-yard and the new-made 
grave!&nbsp; I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me,
that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.&nbsp; 
Hindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps 
meditating on the same subject.&nbsp; He had ceased drinking at a
point below irrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken 
during two or three hours.&nbsp; There was no sound through the 
house but the moaning wind, which shook the windows every now and
then, the faint crackling of the coals, and the click of my 
snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of the 
candle.&nbsp; Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in 
bed.&nbsp; It was very, very sad: and while I read I sighed, for 
it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world, never to be 
restored.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound 
of the kitchen latch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch 
earlier than usual; owing, I suppose, to the sudden storm.&nbsp; 
That entrance was fastened, and we heard him coming round to get 
in by the other.&nbsp; I rose with an irrepressible expression of
what I felt on my lips, which induced my companion, who had been 
staring towards the door, to turn and look at me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep him out five minutes,&rdquo; he 
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t object?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, you may keep him out the whole night for 
me,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do! put the key in the look, 
and draw the bolts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the 
front; he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my
table, leaning over it, and searching in my eyes for a sympathy 
with the burning hate that gleamed from his: as he both looked 
and felt like an assassin, he couldn&rsquo;t exactly find that; 
but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You, and I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have each a 
great debt to settle with the man out yonder!&nbsp; If we were 
neither of us cowards, we might combine to discharge it.&nbsp; 
Are you as soft as your brother?&nbsp; Are you willing to endure 
to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m weary of enduring now,&rdquo; I 
replied; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d be glad of a retaliation that 
wouldn&rsquo;t recoil on myself; but treachery and violence are 
spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them 
worse than their enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Treachery and violence are a just return for 
treachery and violence!&rdquo; cried Hindley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. 
Heathcliff, I&rsquo;ll ask you to do nothing; but sit still and 
be dumb.&nbsp; Tell me now, can you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you 
would have as much pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of 
the fiend&rsquo;s existence; he&rsquo;ll be <i>your</i> death 
unless you overreach him; and he&rsquo;ll be <i>my</i> 
ruin.&nbsp; Damn the hellish villain!&nbsp; He knocks at the door
as if he were master here already!&nbsp; Promise to hold your 
tongue, and before that clock strikes&mdash;it wants three 
minutes of one&mdash;you&rsquo;re a free woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He took the implements which I described to you in my 
letter from his breast, and would have turned down the 
candle.&nbsp; I snatched it away, however, and seized his 
arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not hold my tongue!&rdquo; I said; 
&ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t touch him.&nbsp; Let the door remain 
shut, and be quiet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve formed my resolution, and 
by God I&rsquo;ll execute it!&rdquo; cried the desperate 
being.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do you a kindness in spite of 
yourself, and Hareton justice!&nbsp; And you needn&rsquo;t 
trouble your head to screen me; Catherine is gone.&nbsp; Nobody 
alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though I cut my throat this
minute&mdash;and it&rsquo;s time to make an end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned
with a lunatic.&nbsp; The only resource left me was to run to a 
lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited 
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better seek shelter somewhere else 
to-night!&rdquo; I exclaimed, in rather a triumphant tone.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you persist in 
endeavouring to enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better open the door, 
you&mdash;&rdquo; he answered, addressing me by some elegant term
that I don&rsquo;t care to repeat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I shall not meddle in the matter,&rdquo; I 
retorted again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in and get shot, if you 
please.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With that I shut the window and returned to my place by
the fire; having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to 
pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him.&nbsp; 
Earnshaw swore passionately at me: affirming that I loved the 
villain yet; and calling me all sorts of names for the base 
spirit I evinced.&nbsp; And I, in my secret heart (and conscience
never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be for 
<i>him</i> should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a 
blessing for <i>me</i> should he send Heathcliff to his right 
abode!&nbsp; As I sat nursing these reflections, the casement 
behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter 
individual, and his black countenance looked blightingly 
through.&nbsp; The stanchions stood too close to suffer his 
shoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied 
security.&nbsp; His hair and clothes were whitened with snow, and
his sharp cannibal teeth, revealed by cold and wrath, gleamed 
through the dark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Isabella, let me in, or I&rsquo;ll make you 
repent!&rdquo; he &ldquo;girned,&rdquo; as Joseph calls it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I cannot commit murder,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with a knife and loaded 
pistol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Let me in by the kitchen door,&rdquo; he 
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hindley will be there before me,&rdquo; I 
answered: &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s a poor love of yours that 
cannot bear a shower of snow!&nbsp; We were left at peace in our 
beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of 
winter returns, you must run for shelter!&nbsp; Heathcliff, if I 
were you, I&rsquo;d go stretch myself over her grave and die like
a faithful dog.&nbsp; The world is surely not worth living in 
now, is it?&nbsp; You had distinctly impressed on me the idea 
that Catherine was the whole joy of your life: I can&rsquo;t 
imagine how you think of surviving her loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s there, is he?&rdquo; exclaimed my 
companion, rushing to the gap.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I can get my arm 
out I can hit him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Ellen, you&rsquo;ll set me down as 
really wicked; but you don&rsquo;t know all, so don&rsquo;t 
judge.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have aided or abetted an attempt on
even <i>his</i> life for anything.&nbsp; Wish that he were dead, 
I must; and therefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved 
by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech, when he 
flung himself on Earnshaw&rsquo;s weapon and wrenched it from his
grasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, 
closed into its owner&rsquo;s wrist.&nbsp; Heathcliff pulled it 
away by main force, slitting up the flesh as it passed on, and 
thrust it dripping into his pocket.&nbsp; He then took a stone, 
struck down the division between two windows, and sprang 
in.&nbsp; His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain 
and the flow of blood, that gushed from an artery or a large 
vein.&nbsp; The ruffian kicked and trampled on him, and dashed 
his head repeatedly against the flags, holding me with one hand, 
meantime, to prevent me summoning Joseph.&nbsp; He exerted 
preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing him 
completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and 
dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle.&nbsp; 
There he tore off the sleeve of Earnshaw&rsquo;s coat, and bound 
up the wound with brutal roughness; spitting and cursing during 
the operation as energetically as he had kicked before.&nbsp; 
Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking the old servant; who,
having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale, hurried 
below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What is ther to do, now? what is ther to do, 
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this to do,&rdquo; thundered 
Heathcliff, &ldquo;that your master&rsquo;s mad; and should he 
last another month, I&rsquo;ll have him to an asylum.&nbsp; And 
how the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless 
hound?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stand muttering and mumbling 
there.&nbsp; Come, I&rsquo;m not going to nurse him.&nbsp; Wash 
that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle&mdash;it is 
more than half brandy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And so ye&rsquo;ve been murthering on 
him?&rdquo; exclaimed Joseph, lifting his hands and eyes in 
horror.&nbsp; &ldquo;If iver I seed a seeght loike this!&nbsp; 
May the Lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the 
middle of the blood, and flung a towel to him; but instead of 
proceeding to dry it up, he joined his hands and began a prayer, 
which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology.&nbsp; I was 
in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing: in fact, I was
as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of 
the gallows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, I forgot you,&rdquo; said the tyrant.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You shall do that.&nbsp; Down with you.&nbsp; And you 
conspire with him against me, do you, viper?&nbsp; There, that is
work fit for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me 
beside Joseph, who steadily concluded his supplications, and then
rose, vowing he would set off for the Grange directly.&nbsp; Mr. 
Linton was a magistrate, and though he had fifty wives dead, he 
should inquire into this.&nbsp; He was so obstinate in his 
resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my
lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing over me, 
heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the account 
in answer to his questions.&nbsp; It required a great deal of 
labour to satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was not the 
aggressor; especially with my hardly-wrung replies.&nbsp; 
However, Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still;
Joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits, and by their 
succour his master presently regained motion and 
consciousness.&nbsp; Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was 
ignorant of the treatment received while insensible, called him 
deliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice his 
atrocious conduct further, but advised him to get to bed.&nbsp; 
To my joy, he left us, after giving this judicious counsel, and 
Hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone.&nbsp; I departed to
my own room, marvelling that I had escaped so easily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This morning, when I came down, about half an hour 
before noon, Mr. Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; 
his evil genius, almost as gaunt and ghastly, leant against the 
chimney.&nbsp; Neither appeared inclined to dine, and, having 
waited till all was cold on the table, I commenced alone.&nbsp; 
Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I experienced a 
certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at intervals, 
I cast a look towards my silent companions, and felt the comfort 
of a quiet conscience within me.&nbsp; After I had done, I 
ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going 
round Earnshaw&rsquo;s seat, and kneeling in the corner beside 
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and 
contemplated his features almost as confidently as if they had 
been turned to stone.&nbsp; His forehead, that I once thought so 
manly, and that I now think so diabolical, was shaded with a 
heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by 
sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes were wet 
then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in an 
expression of unspeakable sadness.&nbsp; Had it been another, I 
would have covered my face in the presence of such grief.&nbsp; 
In <i>his</i> case, I was gratified; and, ignoble as it seems to 
insult a fallen enemy, I couldn&rsquo;t miss this chance of 
sticking in a dart: his weakness was the only time when I could 
taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fie, fie, Miss!&rsquo; I interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;One 
might suppose you had never opened a Bible in your life.&nbsp; If
God afflict your enemies, surely that ought to suffice you.&nbsp;
It is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to 
his!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In general I&rsquo;ll allow that it would be, 
Ellen,&rsquo; she continued; &lsquo;but what misery laid on 
Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand in it?&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;d rather he suffered less, if I might cause his 
sufferings and he might <i>know</i> that I was the cause.&nbsp; 
Oh, I owe him so much.&nbsp; On only one condition can I hope to 
forgive him.&nbsp; It is, if I may take an eye for an eye, a 
tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a wrench: 
reduce him to my level.&nbsp; As he was the first to injure, make
him the first to implore pardon; and then&mdash;why then, Ellen, 
I might show you some generosity.&nbsp; But it is utterly 
impossible I can ever be revenged, and therefore I cannot forgive
him.&nbsp; Hindley wanted some water, and I handed him a glass, 
and asked him how he was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not as ill as I wish,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But leaving out my arm, every inch of me is as sore as if 
I had been fighting with a legion of imps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, no wonder,&rdquo; was my next remark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Catherine used to boast that she stood between you and 
bodily harm: she meant that certain persons would not hurt you 
for fear of offending her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s well people 
don&rsquo;t <i>really</i> rise from their grave, or, last night, 
she might have witnessed a repulsive scene!&nbsp; Are not you 
bruised, and cut over your chest and shoulders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; he answered, 
&ldquo;but what do you mean?&nbsp; Did he dare to strike me when 
I was down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on
the ground,&rdquo; I whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And his mouth 
watered to tear you with his teeth; because he&rsquo;s only half 
man: not so much, and the rest fiend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of 
our mutual foe; who, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible 
to anything around him: the longer he stood, the plainer his 
reflections revealed their blackness through his features.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, if God would but give me strength to 
strangle him in my last agony, I&rsquo;d go to hell with 
joy,&rdquo; groaned the impatient man, writhing to rise, and 
sinking back in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the 
struggle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nay, it&rsquo;s enough that he has murdered one 
of you,&rdquo; I observed aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the Grange, 
every one knows your sister would have been living now had it not
been for Mr. Heathcliff.&nbsp; After all, it is preferable to be 
hated than loved by him.&nbsp; When I recollect how happy we 
were&mdash;how happy Catherine was before he came&mdash;I&rsquo;m
fit to curse the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what 
was said, than the spirit of the person who said it.&nbsp; His 
attention was roused, I saw, for his eyes rained down tears among
the ashes, and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs.&nbsp; I 
stared full at him, and laughed scornfully.&nbsp; The clouded 
windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which 
usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did
not fear to hazard another sound of derision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Get up, and begone out of my sight,&rdquo; said 
the mourner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his 
voice was hardly intelligible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But I loved Catherine too; and her brother requires 
attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply.&nbsp; Now, that 
she&rsquo;s dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her 
eyes, if you had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black
and red; and her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to 
death!&rdquo; he cried, making a movement that caused me to make 
one also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; I continued, holding myself 
ready to flee, &ldquo;if poor Catherine had trusted you, and 
assumed the ridiculous, contemptible, degrading title of Mrs. 
Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a similar 
picture!&nbsp; <i>She</i> wouldn&rsquo;t have borne your 
abominable behaviour quietly: her detestation and disgust must 
have found voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The back of the settle and Earnshaw&rsquo;s person 
interposed between me and him; so instead of endeavouring to 
reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife from the table and flung it 
at my head.&nbsp; It struck beneath my ear, and stopped the 
sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the 
door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper 
than his missile.&nbsp; The last glimpse I caught of him was a 
furious rush on his part, checked by the embrace of his host; and
both fell locked together on the hearth.&nbsp; In my flight 
through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to his master; I knocked 
over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies from a 
chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from 
purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,
quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over 
banks, and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact,
towards the beacon-light of the Grange.&nbsp; And far rather 
would I be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal 
regions than, even for one night, abide beneath the roof of 
Wuthering Heights again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she 
rose, and bidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had 
brought, and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to 
remain another hour, she stepped on to a chair, kissed 
Edgar&rsquo;s and Catherine&rsquo;s portraits, bestowed a similar
salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by 
Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress.&nbsp;
She was driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but a 
regular correspondence was established between her and my master 
when things were more settled.&nbsp; I believe her new abode was 
in the south, near London; there she had a son born a few months 
subsequent to her escape.&nbsp; He was christened Linton, and, 
from the first, she reported him to be an ailing, peevish 
creature.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired 
where she lived.&nbsp; I refused to tell.&nbsp; He remarked that 
it was not of any moment, only she must beware of coming to her 
brother: she should not be with him, if he had to keep her 
himself.&nbsp; Though I would give no information, he discovered,
through some of the other servants, both her place of residence 
and the existence of the child.&nbsp; Still, he didn&rsquo;t 
molest her: for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I
suppose.&nbsp; He often asked about the infant, when he saw me; 
and on hearing its name, smiled grimly, and observed: &lsquo;They
wish me to hate it too, do they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think they wish you to know anything 
about it,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll have it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;when I 
want it.&nbsp; They may reckon on that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some 
thirteen years after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was 
twelve, or a little more.</p>
<p>On the day succeeding Isabella&rsquo;s unexpected visit I had 
no opportunity of speaking to my master: he shunned conversation,
and was fit for discussing nothing.&nbsp; When I could get him to
listen, I saw it pleased him that his sister had left her 
husband; whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of
his nature would scarcely seem to allow.&nbsp; So deep and 
sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from going anywhere
where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff.&nbsp; Grief, 
and that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he 
threw up his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, 
avoided the village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire 
seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds; only varied 
by solitary rambles on the moors, and visits to the grave of his 
wife, mostly at evening, or early morning before other wanderers 
were abroad.&nbsp; But he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy 
long.&nbsp; <i>He</i> didn&rsquo;t pray for Catherine&rsquo;s 
soul to haunt him.&nbsp; Time brought resignation, and a 
melancholy sweeter than common joy.&nbsp; He recalled her memory 
with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the better 
world; where he doubted not she was gone.</p>
<p>And he had earthly consolation and affections also.&nbsp; For 
a few days, I said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to
the departed: that coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and 
ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step it 
wielded a despot&rsquo;s sceptre in his heart.&nbsp; It was named
Catherine; but he never called it the name in full, as he had 
never called the first Catherine short: probably because 
Heathcliff had a habit of doing so.&nbsp; The little one was 
always Cathy: it formed to him a distinction from the mother, and
yet a connection with her; and his attachment sprang from its 
relation to her, far more than from its being his own.</p>
<p>I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, 
and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct 
was so opposite in similar circumstances.&nbsp; They had both 
been fond husbands, and were both attached to their children; and
I could not see how they shouldn&rsquo;t both have taken the same
road, for good or evil.&nbsp; But, I thought in my mind, Hindley,
with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the 
worse and the weaker man.&nbsp; When his ship struck, the captain
abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her, 
rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their 
luckless vessel.&nbsp; Linton, on the contrary, displayed the 
true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he trusted God; and 
God comforted him.&nbsp; One hoped, and the other despaired: they
chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure 
them.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll not want to hear my moralising, Mr. 
Lockwood; you&rsquo;ll judge, as well as I can, all these things:
at least, you&rsquo;ll think you will, and that&rsquo;s the 
same.&nbsp; The end of Earnshaw was what might have been 
expected; it followed fast on his sister&rsquo;s: there were 
scarcely six months between them.&nbsp; We, at the Grange, never 
got a very succinct account of his state preceding it; all that I
did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for
the funeral.&nbsp; Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to my 
master.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Nelly,&rsquo; said he, riding into the yard one 
morning, too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment 
of bad news, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s yours and my turn to go into 
mourning at present.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s given us the slip now, do 
you think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; I asked in a flurry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, guess!&rsquo; he returned, dismounting, and 
slinging his bridle on a hook by the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;And nip 
up the corner of your apron: I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;ll need 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?&rsquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! would you have tears for him?&rsquo; said the 
doctor.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, Heathcliff&rsquo;s a tough young fellow:
he looks blooming to-day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just seen him.&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;s rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better 
half.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?&rsquo; I repeated 
impatiently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hindley Earnshaw!&nbsp; Your old friend Hindley,&rsquo;
he replied, &lsquo;and my wicked gossip: though he&rsquo;s been 
too wild for me this long while.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; I said we 
should draw water.&nbsp; But cheer up!&nbsp; He died true to his 
character: drunk as a lord.&nbsp; Poor lad!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m 
sorry, too.&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t help missing an old companion: 
though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined, 
and has done me many a rascally turn.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s barely 
twenty-seven, it seems; that&rsquo;s your own age: who would have
thought you were born in one year?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. 
Linton&rsquo;s death: ancient associations lingered round my 
heart; I sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation, 
desiring Mr. Kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to 
the master.&nbsp; I could not hinder myself from pondering on the
question&mdash;&lsquo;Had he had fair play?&rsquo;&nbsp; Whatever
I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely 
pertinacious that I resolved on requesting leave to go to 
Wuthering Heights, and assist in the last duties to the 
dead.&nbsp; Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to consent, but I 
pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay; 
and I said my old master and foster-brother had a claim on my 
services as strong as his own.&nbsp; Besides, I reminded him that
the child Hareton was his wife&rsquo;s nephew, and, in the 
absence of nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he 
ought to and must inquire how the property was left, and look 
over the concerns of his brother-in-law.&nbsp; He was unfit for 
attending to such matters then, but he bid me speak to his 
lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.&nbsp; His lawyer had 
been Earnshaw&rsquo;s also: I called at the village, and asked 
him to accompany me.&nbsp; He shook his head, and advised that 
Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, if the truth were 
known, Hareton would be found little else than a beggar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His father died in debt,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;the 
whole property is mortgaged, and the sole chance for the natural 
heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in 
the creditor&rsquo;s heart, that he may be inclined to deal 
leniently towards him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see
everything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in 
sufficient distress, expressed satisfaction at my presence.&nbsp;
Mr. Heathcliff said he did not perceive that I was wanted; but I 
might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral, if I 
chose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Correctly,&rsquo; he remarked, &lsquo;that fool&rsquo;s
body should he buried at the cross-roads, without ceremony of any
kind.&nbsp; I happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday 
afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two doors of the 
house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking himself 
to death deliberately!&nbsp; We broke in this morning, for we 
heard him sporting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the 
settle: flaying and scalping would not have wakened him.&nbsp; I 
sent for Kenneth, and he came; but not till the beast had changed
into carrion: he was both dead and cold, and stark; and so 
you&rsquo;ll allow it was useless making more stir about 
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d rayther he&rsquo;d goan hisseln for t&rsquo; 
doctor!&nbsp; I sud ha,&rsquo; taen tent o&rsquo; t&rsquo; 
maister better nor him&mdash;and he warn&rsquo;t deead when I 
left, naught o&rsquo; t&rsquo; soart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I insisted on the funeral being respectable.&nbsp; Mr. 
Heathcliff said I might have my own way there too: only, he 
desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came 
out of his pocket.&nbsp; He maintained a hard, careless 
deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if anything, it
expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work 
successfully executed.&nbsp; I observed once, indeed, something 
like exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were 
bearing the coffin from the house.&nbsp; He had the hypocrisy to 
represent a mourner: and previous to following with Hareton, he 
lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered, with 
peculiar gusto, &lsquo;Now, my bonny lad, you are 
<i>mine</i>!&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ll see if one tree won&rsquo;t 
grow as crooked as another, with the same wind to twist 
it!&rsquo;&nbsp; The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this 
speech: he played with Heathcliff&rsquo;s whiskers, and stroked 
his cheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, 
&lsquo;That boy must go back with me to Thrushcross Grange, 
sir.&nbsp; There is nothing in the world less yours than he 
is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does Linton say so?&rsquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course&mdash;he has ordered me to take him,&rsquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the scoundrel, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll not
argue the subject now: but I have a fancy to try my hand at 
rearing a young one; so intimate to your master that I must 
supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to remove 
it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but 
I&rsquo;ll be pretty sure to make the other come!&nbsp; Remember 
to tell him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This hint was enough to bind our hands.&nbsp; I repeated its 
substance on my return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at 
the commencement, spoke no more of interfering.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m 
not aware that he could have done it to any purpose, had he been 
ever so willing.</p>
<p>The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held 
firm possession, and proved to the attorney&mdash;who, in his 
turn, proved it to Mr. Linton&mdash;that Earnshaw had mortgaged 
every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for 
gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the mortgagee.&nbsp; In that 
manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman in the 
neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on 
his father&rsquo;s inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house 
as a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to
right himself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance 
that he has been wronged.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal 
period were the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in 
their passage rose from our little lady&rsquo;s trifling 
illnesses, which she had to experience in common with all 
children, rich and poor.&nbsp; For the rest, after the first six 
months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and talk too, in 
her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over Mrs. 
Linton&rsquo;s dust.&nbsp; She was the most winning thing that 
ever brought sunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in 
face, with the Earnshaws&rsquo; handsome dark eyes, but the 
Lintons&rsquo; fair skin and small features, and yellow curling 
hair.&nbsp; Her spirit was high, though not rough, and qualified 
by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its 
affections.&nbsp; That capacity for intense attachments reminded 
me of her mother: still she did not resemble her: for she could 
be soft and mild as a dove, and she had a gentle voice and 
pensive expression: her anger was never furious; her love never 
fierce: it was deep and tender.&nbsp; However, it must be 
acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts.&nbsp; A 
propensity to be saucy was one; and a perverse will, that 
indulged children invariably acquire, whether they be good 
tempered or cross.&nbsp; If a servant chanced to vex her, it was 
always&mdash;&lsquo;I shall tell papa!&rsquo;&nbsp; And if he 
reproved her, even by a look, you would have thought it a 
heart-breaking business: I don&rsquo;t believe he ever did speak 
a harsh word to her.&nbsp; He took her education entirely on 
himself, and made it an amusement.&nbsp; Fortunately, curiosity 
and a quick intellect made her an apt scholar: she learned 
rapidly and eagerly, and did honour to his teaching.</p>
<p>Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been 
beyond the range of the park by herself.&nbsp; Mr. Linton would 
take her with him a mile or so outside, on rare occasions; but he
trusted her to no one else.&nbsp; Gimmerton was an unsubstantial 
name in her ears; the chapel, the only building she had 
approached or entered, except her own home.&nbsp; Wuthering 
Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a 
perfect recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented.&nbsp; 
Sometimes, indeed, while surveying the country from her nursery 
window, she would observe&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top
of those hills?&nbsp; I wonder what lies on the other 
side&mdash;is it the sea?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Miss Cathy,&rsquo; I would answer; &lsquo;it is 
hills again, just like these.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what are those golden rocks like when you stand 
under them?&rsquo; she once asked.</p>
<p>The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted 
her notice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the 
topmost heights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in
shadow.&nbsp; I explained that they were bare masses of stone, 
with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted 
tree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why are they bright so long after it is evening 
here?&rsquo; she pursued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because they are a great deal higher up than we 
are,&rsquo; replied I; &lsquo;you could not climb them, they are 
too high and steep.&nbsp; In winter the frost is always there 
before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have found snow 
under that black hollow on the north-east side!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you have been on them!&rsquo; she cried 
gleefully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then I can go, too, when I am a 
woman.&nbsp; Has papa been, Ellen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa would tell you, Miss,&rsquo; I answered, hastily, 
&lsquo;that they are not worth the trouble of visiting.&nbsp; The
moors, where you ramble with him, are much nicer; and Thrushcross
Park is the finest place in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I know the park, and I don&rsquo;t know 
those,&rsquo; she murmured to herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I should 
delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point: my 
little pony Minny shall take me some time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her 
head with a desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton 
about it; and he promised she should have the journey when she 
got older.&nbsp; But Miss Catherine measured her age by months, 
and, &lsquo;Now, am I old enough to go to Penistone Crags?&rsquo;
was the constant question in her mouth.&nbsp; The road thither 
wound close by Wuthering Heights.&nbsp; Edgar had not the heart 
to pass it; so she received as constantly the answer, &lsquo;Not 
yet, love: not yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after 
quitting her husband.&nbsp; Her family were of a delicate 
constitution: she and Edgar both lacked the ruddy health that you
will generally meet in these parts.&nbsp; What her last illness 
was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of the same thing,
a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but incurable, and 
rapidly consuming life towards the close.&nbsp; She wrote to 
inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a 
four-months&rsquo; indisposition under which she had suffered, 
and entreated him to come to her, if possible; for she had much 
to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver Linton 
safely into his hands.&nbsp; Her hope was that Linton might be 
left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she would 
fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his 
maintenance or education.&nbsp; My master hesitated not a moment 
in complying with her request: reluctant as he was to leave home 
at ordinary calls, he flew to answer this; commanding Catherine 
to my peculiar vigilance, in his absence, with reiterated orders 
that she must not wander out of the park, even under my escort he
did not calculate on her going unaccompanied.</p>
<p>He was away three weeks.&nbsp; The first day or two my charge 
sat in a corner of the library, too sad for either reading or 
playing: in that quiet state she caused me little trouble; but it
was succeeded by an interval of impatient, fretful weariness; and
being too busy, and too old then, to run up and down amusing her,
I hit on a method by which she might entertain herself.&nbsp; I 
used to send her on her travels round the grounds&mdash;now on 
foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient audience of
all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.</p>
<p>The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for 
this solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out 
from breakfast till tea; and then the evenings were spent in 
recounting her fanciful tales.&nbsp; I did not fear her breaking 
bounds; because the gates were generally looked, and I thought 
she would scarcely venture forth alone, if they had stood wide 
open.&nbsp; Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.&nbsp; 
Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o&rsquo;clock, and 
said she was that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the 
Desert with his caravan; and I must give her plenty of provision 
for herself and beasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by 
a large hound and a couple of pointers.&nbsp; I got together good
store of dainties, and slung them in a basket on one side of the 
saddle; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy, sheltered by her 
wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted 
off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid 
galloping, and come back early.&nbsp; The naughty thing never 
made her appearance at tea.&nbsp; One traveller, the hound, being
an old dog and fond of its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor
the pony, nor the two pointers were visible in any direction: I 
despatched emissaries down this path, and that path, and at last 
went wandering in search of her myself.&nbsp; There was a 
labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on the borders of
the grounds.&nbsp; I inquired of him if he had seen our young 
lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw her at morn,&rsquo; he replied: &lsquo;she would 
have me to cut her a hazel switch, and then she leapt her 
Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it is lowest, and galloped 
out of sight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>You may guess how I felt at hearing this news.&nbsp; It struck
me directly she must have started for Penistone Crags.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What will become of her?&rsquo; I ejaculated, pushing 
through a gap which the man was repairing, and making straight to
the high-road.&nbsp; I walked as if for a wager, mile after mile,
till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no Catherine 
could I detect, far or near.&nbsp; The Crags lie about a mile and
a half beyond Mr. Heathcliff&rsquo;s place, and that is four from
the Grange, so I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach
them.&nbsp; &lsquo;And what if she should have slipped in 
clambering among them,&rsquo; I reflected, &lsquo;and been 
killed, or broken some of her bones?&rsquo;&nbsp; My suspense was
truly painful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to 
observe, in hurrying by the farmhouse, Charlie, the fiercest of 
the pointers, lying under a window, with swelled head and 
bleeding ear.&nbsp; I opened the wicket and ran to the door, 
knocking vehemently for admittance.&nbsp; A woman whom I knew, 
and who formerly lived at Gimmerton, answered: she had been 
servant there since the death of Mr. Earnshaw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you are come a-seeking your
little mistress!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be frightened.&nbsp; 
She&rsquo;s here safe: but I&rsquo;m glad it isn&rsquo;t the 
master.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not at home then, is he?&rsquo; I panted, quite 
breathless with quick walking and alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she replied: &lsquo;both he and Joseph 
are off, and I think they won&rsquo;t return this hour or 
more.&nbsp; Step in and rest you a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, 
rocking herself in a little chair that had been her 
mother&rsquo;s when a child.&nbsp; Her hat was hung against the 
wall, and she seemed perfectly at home, laughing and chattering, 
in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton&mdash;now a great, 
strong lad of eighteen&mdash;who stared at her with considerable 
curiosity and astonishment: comprehending precious little of the 
fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never
ceased pouring forth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, Miss!&rsquo; I exclaimed, concealing my joy 
under an angry countenance.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is your last ride, 
till papa comes back.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not trust you over the 
threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aha, Ellen!&rsquo; she cried, gaily, jumping up and 
running to my side.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall have a pretty story to 
tell to-night; and so you&rsquo;ve found me out.&nbsp; Have you 
ever been here in your life before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put that hat on, and home at once,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully grieved at you, Miss Cathy: 
you&rsquo;ve done extremely wrong!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use 
pouting and crying: that won&rsquo;t repay the trouble I&rsquo;ve
had, scouring the country after you.&nbsp; To think how Mr. 
Linton charged me to keep you in; and you stealing off so!&nbsp; 
It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will put faith 
in you any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have I done?&rsquo; sobbed she, instantly 
checked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Papa charged me nothing: he&rsquo;ll not 
scold me, Ellen&mdash;he&rsquo;s never cross, like 
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come!&rsquo; I repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll 
tie the riband.&nbsp; Now, let us have no petulance.&nbsp; Oh, 
for shame!&nbsp; You thirteen years old, and such a 
baby!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her 
head, and retreating to the chimney out of my reach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said the servant, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be 
hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean.&nbsp; We made her stop: 
she&rsquo;d fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be 
uneasy.&nbsp; Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he 
should: it&rsquo;s a wild road over the hills.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his 
pockets, too awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not 
relish my intrusion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long am I to wait?&rsquo; I continued, disregarding
the woman&rsquo;s interference.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will be dark in 
ten minutes.&nbsp; Where is the pony, Miss Cathy?&nbsp; And where
is Phoenix?&nbsp; I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so 
please yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The pony is in the yard,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;and
Phoenix is shut in there.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s bitten&mdash;and so is
Charlie.&nbsp; I was going to tell you all about it; but you are 
in a bad temper, and don&rsquo;t deserve to hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but 
perceiving that the people of the house took her part, she 
commenced capering round the room; and on my giving chase, ran 
like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture, rendering 
it ridiculous for me to pursue.&nbsp; Hareton and the woman 
laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more impertinent still; 
till I cried, in great irritation,&mdash;&lsquo;Well, Miss Cathy,
if you were aware whose house this is you&rsquo;d be glad enough 
to get out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s <i>your</i> father&rsquo;s, isn&rsquo;t 
it?&rsquo; said she, turning to Hareton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; he replied, looking down, and blushing 
bashfully.</p>
<p>He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they 
were just his own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose then&mdash;your master&rsquo;s?&rsquo; she 
asked.</p>
<p>He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an 
oath, and turned away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is his master?&rsquo; continued the tiresome girl, 
appealing to me.&nbsp; &lsquo;He talked about &ldquo;our 
house,&rdquo; and &ldquo;our folk.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought he had 
been the owner&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; And he never said Miss: he 
should have done, shouldn&rsquo;t he, if he&rsquo;s a 
servant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish 
speech.&nbsp; I silently shook my questioner, and at last 
succeeded in equipping her for departure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, get my horse,&rsquo; she said, addressing her 
unknown kinsman as she would one of the stable-boys at the 
Grange.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you may come with me.&nbsp; I want to 
see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear about
the <i>fairishes</i>, as you call them: but make haste!&nbsp; 
What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; Get my horse, I say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see thee damned before I be <i>thy</i> 
servant!&rsquo; growled the lad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll see me <i>what</i>!&rsquo; asked Catherine
in surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damned&mdash;thou saucy witch!&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty 
company,&rsquo; I interposed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nice words to be used 
to a young lady!&nbsp; Pray don&rsquo;t begin to dispute with 
him.&nbsp; Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and 
begone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Ellen,&rsquo; cried she, staring fixed in 
astonishment, &lsquo;how dare he speak so to me?&nbsp; 
Mustn&rsquo;t he be made to do as I ask him?&nbsp; You wicked 
creature, I shall tell papa what you said.&mdash;Now, 
then!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears 
sprang into her eyes with indignation.&nbsp; &lsquo;You bring the
pony,&rsquo; she exclaimed, turning to the woman, &lsquo;and let 
my dog free this moment!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Softly, Miss,&rsquo; answered she addressed: 
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ll lose nothing by being civil.&nbsp; Though Mr.
Hareton, there, be not the master&rsquo;s son, he&rsquo;s your 
cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>He</i> my cousin!&rsquo; cried Cathy, with a 
scornful laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed,&rsquo; responded her reprover.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Ellen! don&rsquo;t let them say such things,&rsquo;
she pursued in great trouble.&nbsp; &lsquo;Papa is gone to fetch 
my cousin from London: my cousin is a gentleman&rsquo;s 
son.&nbsp; That my&mdash;&rsquo; she stopped, and wept outright; 
upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush!&rsquo; I whispered; &lsquo;people can have 
many cousins and of all sorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the 
worse for it; only they needn&rsquo;t keep their company, if they
be disagreeable and bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not&mdash;he&rsquo;s not my cousin, 
Ellen!&rsquo; she went on, gathering fresh grief from reflection,
and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea.</p>
<p>I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual 
revelations; having no doubt of Linton&rsquo;s approaching 
arrival, communicated by the former, being reported to Mr. 
Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that Catherine&rsquo;s first
thought on her father&rsquo;s return would be to seek an 
explanation of the latter&rsquo;s assertion concerning her 
rude-bred kindred.&nbsp; Hareton, recovering from his disgust at 
being taken for a servant, seemed moved by her distress; and, 
having fetched the pony round to the door, he took, to propitiate
her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the kennel, and 
putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he meant 
nought.&nbsp; Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with 
a glance of awe and horror, then burst forth anew.</p>
<p>I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the
poor fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in
features, and stout and healthy, but attired in garments 
befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm and 
lounging among the moors after rabbits and game.&nbsp; Still, I 
thought I could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better 
qualities than his father ever possessed.&nbsp; Good things lost 
amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far 
over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, 
evidence of a wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops 
under other and favourable circumstances.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff, I
believe, had not treated him physically ill; thanks to his 
fearless nature, which offered no temptation to that course of 
oppression: he had none of the timid susceptibility that would 
have given zest to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff&rsquo;s 
judgment.&nbsp; He appeared to have bent his malevolence on 
making him a brute: he was never taught to read or write; never 
rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never 
led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept 
against vice.&nbsp; And from what I heard, Joseph contributed 
much to his deterioration, by a narrow-minded partiality which 
prompted him to flatter and pet him, as a boy, because he was the
head of the old family.&nbsp; And as he had been in the habit of 
accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children, of 
putting the master past his patience, and compelling him to seek 
solace in drink by what he termed their &lsquo;offald 
ways,&rsquo; so at present he laid the whole burden of 
Hareton&rsquo;s faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his 
property.&nbsp; If the lad swore, he wouldn&rsquo;t correct him: 
nor however culpably he behaved.&nbsp; It gave Joseph 
satisfaction, apparently, to watch him go the worst lengths: he 
allowed that the lad was ruined: that his soul was abandoned to 
perdition; but then he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for 
it.&nbsp; Hareton&rsquo;s blood would be required at his hands; 
and there lay immense consolation in that thought.&nbsp; Joseph 
had instilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he 
would, had he dared, have fostered hate between him and the 
present owner of the Heights: but his dread of that owner 
amounted to superstition; and he confined his feelings regarding 
him to muttered innuendoes and private comminations.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of 
living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak
from hearsay; for I saw little.&nbsp; The villagers affirmed Mr. 
Heathcliff was <i>near</i>, and a cruel hard landlord to his 
tenants; but the house, inside, had regained its ancient aspect 
of comfort under female management, and the scenes of riot common
in Hindley&rsquo;s time were not now enacted within its 
walls.&nbsp; The master was too gloomy to seek companionship with
any people, good or bad; and he is yet.</p>
<p>This, however, is not making progress with my story.&nbsp; 
Miss Cathy rejected the peace-offering of the terrier, and 
demanded her own dogs, Charlie and Phoenix.&nbsp; They came 
limping and hanging their heads; and we set out for home, sadly 
out of sorts, every one of us.&nbsp; I could not wring from my 
little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I 
supposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she
arrived without adventure to the gate of the farm-house, when 
Hareton happened to issue forth, attended by some canine 
followers, who attacked her train.&nbsp; They had a smart battle,
before their owners could separate them: that formed an 
introduction.&nbsp; Catherine told Hareton who she was, and where
she was going; and asked him to show her the way: finally, 
beguiling him to accompany her.&nbsp; He opened the mysteries of 
the Fairy Cave, and twenty other queer places.&nbsp; But, being 
in disgrace, I was not favoured with a description of the 
interesting objects she saw.&nbsp; I could gather, however, that 
her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by 
addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff&rsquo;s housekeeper 
hurt hers by calling him her cousin.&nbsp; Then the language he 
had held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always 
&lsquo;love,&rsquo; and &lsquo;darling,&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;queen,&rsquo; and &lsquo;angel,&rsquo; with everybody at 
the Grange, to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger!&nbsp; She
did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to obtain a promise 
that she would not lay the grievance before her father.&nbsp; I 
explained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights, 
and how sorry he would be to find she had been there; but I 
insisted most on the fact, that if she revealed my negligence of 
his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that I should have to 
leave; and Cathy couldn&rsquo;t bear that prospect: she pledged 
her word, and kept it for my sake.&nbsp; After all, she was a 
sweet little girl.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my 
master&rsquo;s return, Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me 
get mourning for his daughter, and arrange a room, and other 
accommodations, for his youthful nephew.&nbsp; Catherine ran wild
with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back; and indulged 
most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of 
her &lsquo;real&rsquo; cousin.&nbsp; The evening of their 
expected arrival came.&nbsp; Since early morning she had been 
busy ordering her own small affairs; and now attired in her new 
black frock&mdash;poor thing! her aunt&rsquo;s death impressed 
her with no definite sorrow&mdash;she obliged me, by constant 
worrying, to walk with her down through the grounds to meet 
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Linton is just six months younger than I am,&rsquo; she
chattered, as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows 
of mossy turf, under shadow of the trees.&nbsp; &lsquo;How 
delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow!&nbsp; Aunt 
Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it was lighter 
than mine&mdash;more flaxen, and quite as fine.&nbsp; I have it 
carefully preserved in a little glass box; and I&rsquo;ve often 
thought what a pleasure it would be to see its owner.&nbsp; Oh! I
am happy&mdash;and papa, dear, dear papa!&nbsp; Come, Ellen, let 
us run! come, run.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my 
sober footsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on 
the grassy bank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but
that was impossible: she couldn&rsquo;t be still a minute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long they are!&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Ah, I see, some dust on the road&mdash;they are 
coming!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; When will they be here?&nbsp; May we not 
go a little way&mdash;half a mile, Ellen, only just half a 
mile?&nbsp; Do say Yes: to that clump of birches at the 
turn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I refused staunchly.&nbsp; At length her suspense was ended: 
the travelling carriage rolled in sight.&nbsp; Miss Cathy 
shrieked and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her 
father&rsquo;s face looking from the window.&nbsp; He descended, 
nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval elapsed 
ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves.&nbsp; 
While they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after 
Linton.&nbsp; He was asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, 
fur-lined cloak, as if it had been winter.&nbsp; A pale, 
delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been taken for my 
master&rsquo;s younger brother, so strong was the resemblance: 
but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar 
Linton never had.&nbsp; The latter saw me looking; and having 
shaken hands, advised me to close the door, and leave him 
undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him.&nbsp; Cathy would 
fain have taken one glance, but her father told her to come, and 
they walked together up the park, while I hastened before to 
prepare the servants.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, darling,&rsquo; said Mr. Linton, addressing his 
daughter, as they halted at the bottom of the front steps: 
&lsquo;your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are, and 
he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time since; 
therefore, don&rsquo;t expect him to play and run about with you 
directly.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t harass him much by talking: let 
him be quiet this evening, at least, will you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, papa,&rsquo; answered Catherine: &lsquo;but I
do want to see him; and he hasn&rsquo;t once looked 
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted
to the ground by his uncle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,&rsquo; he said, 
putting their little hands together.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s 
fond of you already; and mind you don&rsquo;t grieve her by 
crying to-night.&nbsp; Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is 
at an end, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself
as you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me go to bed, then,&rsquo; answered the boy, 
shrinking from Catherine&rsquo;s salute; and he put his fingers 
to remove incipient tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come, there&rsquo;s a good child,&rsquo; I 
whispered, leading him in.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll make her 
weep too&mdash;see how sorry she is for you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin 
put on as sad a countenance as himself, and returned to her 
father.&nbsp; All three entered, and mounted to the library, 
where tea was laid ready.&nbsp; I proceeded to remove 
Linton&rsquo;s cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair by the 
table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry 
afresh.&nbsp; My master inquired what was the matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t sit on a chair,&rsquo; sobbed the 
boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some 
tea,&rsquo; answered his uncle patiently.</p>
<p>He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt 
convinced, by his fretful ailing charge.&nbsp; Linton slowly 
trailed himself off, and lay down.&nbsp; Cathy carried a 
footstool and her cup to his side.&nbsp; At first she sat silent;
but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her 
little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced 
stroking his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea 
in her saucer, like a baby.&nbsp; This pleased him, for he was 
not much better: he dried his eyes, and lightened into a faint 
smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll do very well,&rsquo; said the master to
me, after watching them a minute.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well, if we 
can keep him, Ellen.&nbsp; The company of a child of his own age 
will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for strength
he&rsquo;ll gain it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, if we can keep him!&rsquo; I mused to myself; and 
sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of 
that.&nbsp; And then, I thought, how ever will that weakling live
at Wuthering Heights?&nbsp; Between his father and Hareton, what 
playmates and instructors they&rsquo;ll be.&nbsp; Our doubts were
presently decided&mdash;even earlier than I expected.&nbsp; I had
just taken the children up-stairs, after tea was finished, and 
seen Linton asleep&mdash;he would not suffer me to leave him till
that was the case&mdash;I had come down, and was standing by the 
table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle for Mr. Edgar, when 
a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that Mr. 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s servant Joseph was at the door, and wished to 
speak with the master.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall ask him what he wants first,&rsquo; I said, in 
considerable trepidation.&nbsp; &lsquo;A very unlikely hour to be
troubling people, and the instant they have returned from a long 
journey.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think the master can see 
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these 
words, and now presented himself in the hall.&nbsp; He was donned
in his Sunday garments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest 
face, and, holding his hat in one hand, and his stick in the 
other, he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-evening, Joseph,&rsquo; I said, coldly.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What business brings you here to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s Maister Linton I mun spake to,&rsquo; he 
answered, waving me disdainfully aside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something 
particular to say, I&rsquo;m sure he won&rsquo;t hear it 
now,&rsquo; I continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;You had better sit down in 
there, and entrust your message to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which is his rahm?&rsquo; pursued the fellow, surveying
the range of closed doors.</p>
<p>I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very 
reluctantly I went up to the library, and announced the 
unseasonable visitor, advising that he should be dismissed till 
next day.&nbsp; Mr. Linton had no time to empower me to do so, 
for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and, pushing into the 
apartment, planted himself at the far side of the table, with his
two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began in an 
elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn&rsquo;t 
goa back &lsquo;bout him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding 
sorrow overcast his features: he would have pitied the child on 
his own account; but, recalling Isabella&rsquo;s hopes and fears,
and anxious wishes for her son, and her commendations of him to 
his care, he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up,
and searched in his heart how it might be avoided.&nbsp; No plan 
offered itself: the very exhibition of any desire to keep him 
would have rendered the claimant more peremptory: there was 
nothing left but to resign him.&nbsp; However, he was not going 
to rouse him from his sleep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell Mr. Heathcliff,&rsquo; he answered calmly, 
&lsquo;that his son shall come to Wuthering Heights 
to-morrow.&nbsp; He is in bed, and too tired to go the distance 
now.&nbsp; You may also tell him that the mother of Linton 
desired him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his
health is very precarious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Noa!&rsquo; said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on
the floor, and assuming an authoritative air.&nbsp; &lsquo;Noa! 
that means naught.&nbsp; Hathecliff maks noa &lsquo;count 
o&rsquo; t&rsquo; mother, nor ye norther; but he&rsquo;ll 
heu&rsquo; his lad; und I mun tak&rsquo; him&mdash;soa now ye 
knaw!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall not to-night!&rsquo; answered Linton 
decisively.&nbsp; &lsquo;Walk down stairs at once, and repeat to 
your master what I have said.&nbsp; Ellen, show him down.&nbsp; 
Go&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid
the room of him and closed the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Varrah weell!&rsquo; shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew 
off.&nbsp; &lsquo;To-morn, he&rsquo;s come hisseln, and thrust 
<i>him</i> out, if ye darr!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. 
Linton commissioned me to take the boy home early, on 
Catherine&rsquo;s pony; and, said he&mdash;&lsquo;As we shall now
have no influence over his destiny, good or bad, you must say 
nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she cannot associate 
with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain in 
ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and 
anxious to visit the Heights.&nbsp; Merely tell her his father 
sent for him suddenly, and he has been obliged to leave 
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five 
o&rsquo;clock, and astonished to be informed that he must prepare
for further travelling; but I softened off the matter by stating 
that he was going to spend some time with his father, Mr. 
Heathcliff, who wished to see him so much, he did not like to 
defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late 
journey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father!&rsquo; he cried, in strange 
perplexity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mamma never told me I had a 
father.&nbsp; Where does he live?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather stay 
with uncle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He lives a little distance from the Grange,&rsquo; I 
replied; &lsquo;just beyond those hills: not so far, but you may 
walk over here when you get hearty.&nbsp; And you should be glad 
to go home, and to see him.&nbsp; You must try to love him, as 
you did your mother, and then he will love you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why have I not heard of him before?&rsquo; asked 
Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t mamma and he live together,
as other people do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He had business to keep him in the north,&rsquo; I 
answered, &lsquo;and your mother&rsquo;s health required her to 
reside in the south.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why didn&rsquo;t mamma speak to me about 
him?&rsquo; persevered the child.&nbsp; &lsquo;She often talked 
of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago.&nbsp; How am I to 
love papa?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, all children love their parents,&rsquo; I 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your mother, perhaps, thought you would want 
to be with him if she mentioned him often to you.&nbsp; Let us 
make haste.&nbsp; An early ride on such a beautiful morning is 
much preferable to an hour&rsquo;s more sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is <i>she</i> to go with us,&rsquo; he demanded, 
&lsquo;the little girl I saw yesterday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not now,&rsquo; replied I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is uncle?&rsquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I shall be your companion there,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown 
study.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t go without uncle,&rsquo; he cried at 
length: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell where you mean to take 
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing 
reluctance to meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any 
progress towards dressing, and I had to call for my 
master&rsquo;s assistance in coaxing him out of bed.&nbsp; The 
poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive assurances 
that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would 
visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I 
invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way.&nbsp; 
The pure heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle
canter of Minny, relieved his despondency after a while.&nbsp; He
began to put questions concerning his new home, and its 
inhabitants, with greater interest and liveliness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross
Grange?&rsquo; he inquired, turning to take a last glance into 
the valley, whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud
on the skirts of the blue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not so buried in trees,&rsquo; I replied, 
&lsquo;and it is not quite so large, but you can see the country 
beautifully all round; and the air is healthier for 
you&mdash;fresher and drier.&nbsp; You will, perhaps, think the 
building old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house:
the next best in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; And you will have such 
nice rambles on the moors.&nbsp; Hareton Earnshaw&mdash;that is, 
Miss Cathy&rsquo;s other cousin, and so yours in a 
manner&mdash;will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can 
bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study;
and, now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, 
frequently, walk out on the hills.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is my father like?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Is he as young and handsome as uncle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s as young,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but he has 
black hair and eyes, and looks sterner; and he is taller and 
bigger altogether.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll not seem to you so gentle 
and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still, 
mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally 
he&rsquo;ll be fonder of you than any uncle, for you are his 
own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Black hair and eyes!&rsquo; mused Linton.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t fancy him.&nbsp; Then I am not like him, am 
I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not much,&rsquo; I answered: not a morsel, I thought, 
surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my 
companion, and his large languid eyes&mdash;his mother&rsquo;s 
eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a 
moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How strange that he should never come to see mamma and 
me!&rsquo; he murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has he ever seen me?&nbsp; 
If he has, I must have been a baby.&nbsp; I remember not a single
thing about him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Master Linton,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;three hundred
miles is a great distance; and ten years seem very different in 
length to a grown-up person compared with what they do to 
you.&nbsp; It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going from 
summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and 
now it is too late.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t trouble him with questions 
on the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the 
remainder of the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse 
garden-gate.&nbsp; I watched to catch his impressions in his 
countenance.&nbsp; He surveyed the carved front and low-browed 
lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and crooked firs, with
solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his private feelings 
entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.&nbsp; But 
he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation
within.&nbsp; Before he dismounted, I went and opened the 
door.&nbsp; It was half-past six; the family had just finished 
breakfast: the servant was clearing and wiping down the 
table.&nbsp; Joseph stood by his master&rsquo;s chair telling 
some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing for 
the hayfield.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hallo, Nelly!&rsquo; said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw 
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I feared I should have to come down and fetch my
property myself.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve brought it, have you?&nbsp; 
Let us see what we can make of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed 
in gaping curiosity.&nbsp; Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over 
the faces of the three.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure-ly,&rsquo; said Joseph after a grave inspection, 
&lsquo;he&rsquo;s swopped wi&rsquo; ye, Maister, an&rsquo; 
yon&rsquo;s his lass!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, 
uttered a scornful laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming 
thing!&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t they
reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly?&nbsp; Oh, damn my soul!
but that&rsquo;s worse than I expected&mdash;and the devil knows 
I was not sanguine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and 
enter.&nbsp; He did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his 
father&rsquo;s speech, or whether it were intended for him: 
indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim, sneering stranger 
was his father.&nbsp; But he clung to me with growing 
trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff&rsquo;s taking a seat and 
bidding him &lsquo;come hither&rsquo; he hid his face on my 
shoulder and wept.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tut, tut!&rsquo; said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand
and dragging him roughly between his knees, and then holding up 
his head by the chin.&nbsp; &lsquo;None of that nonsense!&nbsp; 
We&rsquo;re not going to hurt thee, Linton&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that
thy name?&nbsp; Thou art thy mother&rsquo;s child, 
entirely!&nbsp; Where is my share in thee, puling 
chicken?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took off the boy&rsquo;s cap and pushed back his thick 
flaxen curls, felt his slender arms and his small fingers; during
which examination Linton ceased crying, and lifted his great blue
eyes to inspect the inspector.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know me?&rsquo; asked Heathcliff, having 
satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and 
feeble.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of me, I daresay?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he replied again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; What a shame of your mother, never to waken 
your filial regard for me!&nbsp; You are my son, then, I&rsquo;ll
tell you; and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in 
ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.&nbsp; Now, 
don&rsquo;t wince, and colour up!&nbsp; Though it is something to
see you have not white blood.&nbsp; Be a good lad; and I&rsquo;ll
do for you.&nbsp; Nelly, if you be tired you may sit down; if 
not, get home again.&nbsp; I guess you&rsquo;ll report what you 
hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing 
won&rsquo;t be settled while you linger about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be 
kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or you&rsquo;ll not keep him 
long; and he&rsquo;s all you have akin in the wide world, that 
you will ever know&mdash;remember.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be very kind to him, you needn&rsquo;t 
fear,&rsquo; he said, laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only nobody else 
must be kind to him: I&rsquo;m jealous of monopolising his 
affection.&nbsp; And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad
some breakfast.&nbsp; Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your 
work.&nbsp; Yes, Nell,&rsquo; he added, when they had departed, 
&lsquo;my son is prospective owner of your place, and I should 
not wish him to die till I was certain of being his 
successor.&nbsp; Besides, he&rsquo;s <i>mine</i>, and I want the 
triumph of seeing <i>my</i> descendant fairly lord of their 
estates; my child hiring their children to till their 
fathers&rsquo; lands for wages.&nbsp; That is the sole 
consideration which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him 
for himself, and hate him for the memories he revives!&nbsp; But 
that consideration is sufficient: he&rsquo;s as safe with me, and
shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own.&nbsp; 
I have a room up-stairs, furnished for him in handsome style; 
I&rsquo;ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, 
from twenty miles&rsquo; distance, to teach him what he pleases 
to learn.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve ordered Hareton to obey him: and in 
fact I&rsquo;ve arranged everything with a view to preserve the 
superior and the gentleman in him, above his associates.&nbsp; I 
do regret, however, that he so little deserves the trouble: if I 
wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a worthy 
object of pride; and I&rsquo;m bitterly disappointed with the 
whey-faced, whining wretch!&rsquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of 
milk-porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the
homely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not 
eat it.&nbsp; I saw the old man-servant shared largely in his 
master&rsquo;s scorn of the child; though he was compelled to 
retain the sentiment in his heart, because Heathcliff plainly 
meant his underlings to hold him in honour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cannot ate it?&rsquo; repeated he, peering in 
Linton&rsquo;s face, and subduing his voice to a whisper, for 
fear of being overheard.&nbsp; &lsquo;But Maister Hareton nivir 
ate naught else, when he wer a little &rsquo;un; and what wer 
gooid enough for him&rsquo;s gooid enough for ye, I&rsquo;s 
rayther think!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t</i> eat it!&rsquo; answered 
Linton, snappishly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take it away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to 
us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there aught ails th&rsquo; victuals?&rsquo; he 
asked, thrusting the tray under Heathcliff&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What should ail them?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wah!&rsquo; answered Joseph, &lsquo;yon dainty chap 
says he cannut ate &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But I guess it&rsquo;s 
raight!&nbsp; His mother wer just soa&mdash;we wer a&rsquo;most 
too mucky to sow t&rsquo; corn for makking her breead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention his mother to me,&rsquo; said the 
master, angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get him something that he can eat, 
that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; What is his usual food, Nelly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received 
instructions to prepare some.&nbsp; Come, I reflected, his 
father&rsquo;s selfishness may contribute to his comfort.&nbsp; 
He perceives his delicate constitution, and the necessity of 
treating him tolerably.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll console Mr. Edgar by 
acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff&rsquo;s humour has 
taken.&nbsp; Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped 
out, while Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances 
of a friendly sheep-dog.&nbsp; But he was too much on the alert 
to be cheated: as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and a frantic
repetition of the words&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not stay 
here!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not stay here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to
come forth.&nbsp; I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and 
so my brief guardianship ended.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high 
glee, eager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and 
lamentations followed the news of his departure that Edgar 
himself was obliged to soothe her, by affirming he should come 
back soon: he added, however, &lsquo;if I can get him&rsquo;; and
there were no hopes of that.&nbsp; This promise poorly pacified 
her; but time was more potent; and though still at intervals she 
inquired of her father when Linton would return, before she did 
see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that 
she did not recognise him.</p>
<p>When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering 
Heights, in paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask 
how the young master got on; for he lived almost as secluded as 
Catherine herself, and was never to be seen.&nbsp; I could gather
from her that he continued in weak health, and was a tiresome 
inmate.&nbsp; She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever 
longer and worse, though he took some trouble to conceal it: he 
had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could not do at 
all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes 
together.&nbsp; There seldom passed much talk between them: 
Linton learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small 
apartment they called the parlour: or else lay in bed all day: 
for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and aches, and 
pains of some sort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I never know such a fainthearted creature,&rsquo; 
added the woman; &lsquo;nor one so careful of hisseln.&nbsp; He 
<i>will</i> go on, if I leave the window open a bit late in the 
evening.&nbsp; Oh! it&rsquo;s killing, a breath of night 
air!&nbsp; And he must have a fire in the middle of summer; and 
Joseph&rsquo;s bacca-pipe is poison; and he must always have 
sweets and dainties, and always milk, milk for ever&mdash;heeding
naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter; and there 
he&rsquo;ll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the 
fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip 
at; and if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him&mdash;Hareton is
not bad-natured, though he&rsquo;s rough&mdash;they&rsquo;re sure
to part, one swearing and the other crying.&nbsp; I believe the 
master would relish Earnshaw&rsquo;s thrashing him to a mummy, if
he were not his son; and I&rsquo;m certain he would be fit to 
turn him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives 
hisseln.&nbsp; But then he won&rsquo;t go into danger of 
temptation: he never enters the parlour, and should Linton show 
those ways in the house where he is, he sends him up-stairs 
directly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had 
rendered young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were 
not so originally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed:
though still I was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a 
wish that he had been left with us.&nbsp; Mr. Edgar encouraged me
to gain information: he thought a great deal about him, I fancy, 
and would have run some risk to see him; and he told me once to 
ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village?&nbsp; 
She said he had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his 
father; and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for 
three or four days afterwards.&nbsp; That housekeeper left, if I 
recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I 
did not know, was her successor; she lives there still.</p>
<p>Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till 
Miss Cathy reached sixteen.&nbsp; On the anniversary of her birth
we never manifested any signs of rejoicing, because it was also 
the anniversary of my late mistress&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Her 
father invariably spent that day alone in the library; and 
walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he would 
frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.&nbsp; Therefore 
Catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement.&nbsp; 
This twentieth of March was a beautiful spring day, and when her 
father had retired, my young lady came down dressed for going 
out, and said she asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moor 
with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave, if we went only a short 
distance and were back within the hour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So make haste, Ellen!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
know where I wish to go; where a colony of moor-game are settled:
I want to see whether they have made their nests yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That must be a good distance up,&rsquo; I answered; 
&lsquo;they don&rsquo;t breed on the edge of the moor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s not,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve gone very near with papa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of 
the matter.&nbsp; She bounded before me, and returned to my side,
and was off again like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found 
plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and
near, and enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my
pet and my delight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind,
and her bright cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild 
rose, and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure.&nbsp; She was
a happy creature, and an angel, in those days.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
pity she could not be content.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;where are your moor-game, 
Miss Cathy?&nbsp; We should be at them: the Grange park-fence is 
a great way off now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, a little further&mdash;only a little further, 
Ellen,&rsquo; was her answer, continually.&nbsp; &lsquo;Climb to 
that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you reach the other
side I shall have raised the birds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, 
that, at length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, 
and retrace our steps.&nbsp; I shouted to her, as she had 
outstripped me a long way; she either did not hear or did not 
regard, for she still sprang on, and I was compelled to 
follow.&nbsp; Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I came
in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights
than her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, 
one of whom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.</p>
<p>Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least,
hunting out the nests of the grouse.&nbsp; The Heights were 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s land, and he was reproving the poacher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve neither taken any nor found any,&rsquo; she 
said, as I toiled to them, expanding her hands in corroboration 
of the statement.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to take them; 
but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I wished to 
see the eggs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing
his acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his 
malevolence towards it, and demanded who &lsquo;papa&rsquo; 
was?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,&rsquo; she 
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought you did not know me, or you 
wouldn&rsquo;t have spoken in that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, 
then?&rsquo; he said, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what are you?&rsquo; inquired Catherine, gazing 
curiously on the speaker.&nbsp; &lsquo;That man I&rsquo;ve seen 
before.&nbsp; Is he your son?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained 
nothing but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two 
years to his age: he seemed as awkward and rough as ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Cathy,&rsquo; I interrupted, &lsquo;it will be 
three hours instead of one that we are out, presently.&nbsp; We 
really must go back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, that man is not my son,&rsquo; answered Heathcliff,
pushing me aside.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I have one, and you have seen 
him before too; and, though your nurse is in a hurry, I think 
both you and she would be the better for a little rest.&nbsp; 
Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my 
house?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll get home earlier for the ease; and you 
shall receive a kind welcome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I whispered Catherine that she mustn&rsquo;t, on any account, 
accede to the proposal: it was entirely out of the question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; she asked, aloud.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m 
tired of running, and the ground is dewy: I can&rsquo;t sit 
here.&nbsp; Let us go, Ellen.&nbsp; Besides, he says I have seen 
his son.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s mistaken, I think; but I guess where he
lives: at the farmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone&rsquo;
Crags.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do.&nbsp; Come, Nelly, hold your tongue&mdash;it will
he a treat for her to look in on us.&nbsp; Hareton, get forwards 
with the lass.&nbsp; You shall walk with me, Nelly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, she&rsquo;s not going to any such place,&rsquo; I 
cried, struggling to release my arm, which he had seized: but she
was almost at the door-stones already, scampering round the brow 
at full speed.&nbsp; Her appointed companion did not pretend to 
escort her: he shied off by the road-side, and vanished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Heathcliff, it&rsquo;s very wrong,&rsquo; I 
continued: &lsquo;you know you mean no good.&nbsp; And there 
she&rsquo;ll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever we 
return; and I shall have the blame.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want her to see Linton,&rsquo; he answered; 
&lsquo;he&rsquo;s looking better these few days; it&rsquo;s not 
often he&rsquo;s fit to be seen.&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ll soon 
persuade her to keep the visit secret: where is the harm of 
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he 
found I suffered her to enter your house; and I am convinced you 
have a bad design in encouraging her to do so,&rsquo; I 
replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My design is as honest as possible.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll 
inform you of its whole scope,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;That 
the two cousins may fall in love, and get married.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m acting generously to your master: his young chit has no
expectations, and should she second my wishes she&rsquo;ll be 
provided for at once as joint successor with Linton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Linton died,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;and his life 
is quite uncertain, Catherine would be the heir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, she would not,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;There 
is no clause in the will to secure it so: his property would go 
to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire their union, and am 
resolved to bring it about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I&rsquo;m resolved she shall never approach your 
house with me again,&rsquo; I returned, as we reached the gate, 
where Miss Cathy waited our coming.</p>
<p>Heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, 
hastened to open the door.&nbsp; My young lady gave him several 
looks, as if she could not exactly make up her mind what to think
of him; but now he smiled when he met her eye, and softened his 
voice in addressing her; and I was foolish enough to imagine the 
memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring her 
injury.&nbsp; Linton stood on the hearth.&nbsp; He had been out 
walking in the fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to 
Joseph to bring him dry shoes.&nbsp; He had grown tall of his 
age, still wanting some months of sixteen.&nbsp; His features 
were pretty yet, and his eye and complexion brighter than I 
remembered them, though with merely temporary lustre borrowed 
from the salubrious air and genial sun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, who is that?&rsquo; asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning 
to Cathy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can you tell?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your son?&rsquo; she said, having doubtfully surveyed, 
first one and then the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; answered he: &lsquo;but is this the 
only time you have beheld him?&nbsp; Think!&nbsp; Ah! you have a 
short memory.&nbsp; Linton, don&rsquo;t you recall your cousin, 
that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, Linton!&rsquo; cried Cathy, kindling into joyful 
surprise at the name.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that little Linton?&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;s taller than I am!&nbsp; Are you Linton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she 
kissed him fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change 
time had wrought in the appearance of each.&nbsp; Catherine had 
reached her full height; her figure was both plump and slender, 
elastic as steel, and her whole aspect sparkling with health and 
spirits.&nbsp; Linton&rsquo;s looks and movements were very 
languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace in 
his manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not 
unpleasing.&nbsp; After exchanging numerous marks of fondness 
with him, his cousin went to Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the 
door, dividing his attention between the objects inside and those
that lay without: pretending, that is, to observe the latter, and
really noting the former alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you are my uncle, then!&rsquo; she cried, reaching 
up to salute him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought I liked you, though you 
were cross at first.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you visit at the 
Grange with Linton?&nbsp; To live all these years such close 
neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so 
for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I visited it once or twice too often before you were 
born,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&mdash;damn it!&nbsp;
If you have any kisses to spare, give them to Linton: they are 
thrown away on me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Naughty Ellen!&rsquo; exclaimed Catherine, flying to 
attack me next with her lavish caresses.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wicked 
Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll 
take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and 
sometimes bring papa.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you be glad to see 
us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; replied the uncle, with a hardly 
suppressed grimace, resulting from his deep aversion to both the 
proposed visitors.&nbsp; &lsquo;But stay,&rsquo; he continued, 
turning towards the young lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now I think of it, 
I&rsquo;d better tell you.&nbsp; Mr. Linton has a prejudice 
against me: we quarrelled at one time of our lives, with 
unchristian ferocity; and, if you mention coming here to him, 
he&rsquo;ll put a veto on your visits altogether.&nbsp; 
Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless of 
seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you 
must not mention it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you quarrel?&rsquo; asked Catherine, 
considerably crestfallen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He thought me too poor to wed his sister,&rsquo; 
answered Heathcliff, &lsquo;and was grieved that I got her: his 
pride was hurt, and he&rsquo;ll never forgive it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s wrong!&rsquo; said the young lady: 
&lsquo;some time I&rsquo;ll tell him so.&nbsp; But Linton and I 
have no share in your quarrel.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not come here, 
then; he shall come to the Grange.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be too far for me,&rsquo; murmured her cousin: 
&lsquo;to walk four miles would kill me.&nbsp; No, come here, 
Miss Catherine, now and then: not every morning, but once or 
twice a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter 
contempt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,&rsquo; he 
muttered to me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Miss Catherine, as the ninny calls 
her, will discover his value, and send him to the devil.&nbsp; 
Now, if it had been Hareton!&mdash;Do you know that, twenty times
a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
have loved the lad had he been some one else.&nbsp; But I think 
he&rsquo;s safe from <i>her</i> love.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll pit him 
against that paltry creature, unless it bestir itself 
briskly.&nbsp; We calculate it will scarcely last till it is 
eighteen.&nbsp; Oh, confound the vapid thing!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s 
absorbed in drying his feet, and never looks at 
her.&mdash;Linton!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, father,&rsquo; answered the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, 
not even a rabbit or a weasel&rsquo;s nest?&nbsp; Take her into 
the garden, before you change your shoes; and into the stable to 
see your horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather sit here?&rsquo; asked 
Linton, addressing Cathy in a tone which expressed reluctance to 
move again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; she replied, casting a 
longing look to the door, and evidently eager to be active.</p>
<p>He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire.&nbsp; 
Heathcliff rose, and went into the kitchen, and from thence to 
the yard, calling out for Hareton.&nbsp; Hareton responded, and 
presently the two re-entered.&nbsp; The young man had been 
washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and his
wetted hair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll ask <i>you</i>, uncle,&rsquo; cried Miss
Cathy, recollecting the housekeeper&rsquo;s assertion.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;That is not my cousin, is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he, replied, &lsquo;your mother&rsquo;s 
nephew.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you like him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine looked queer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he not a handsome lad?&rsquo; he continued.</p>
<p>The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a 
sentence in Heathcliff&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; He laughed; Hareton 
darkened: I perceived he was very sensitive to suspected slights,
and had obviously a dim notion of his inferiority.&nbsp; But his 
master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be the favourite among us, Hareton!&nbsp; 
She says you are a&mdash;What was it?&nbsp; Well, something very 
flattering.&nbsp; Here! you go with her round the farm.&nbsp; And
behave like a gentleman, mind!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t use any bad 
words; and don&rsquo;t stare when the young lady is not looking 
at you, and be ready to hide your face when she is; and, when you
speak, say your words slowly, and keep your hands out of your 
pockets.&nbsp; Be off, and entertain her as nicely as you 
can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He watched the couple walking past the window.&nbsp; Earnshaw 
had his countenance completely averted from his companion.&nbsp; 
He seemed studying the familiar landscape with a stranger&rsquo;s
and an artist&rsquo;s interest.&nbsp; Catherine took a sly look 
at him, expressing small admiration.&nbsp; She then turned her 
attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself, and 
tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of 
conversation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve tied his tongue,&rsquo; observed 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll not venture a single 
syllable all the time!&nbsp; Nelly, you recollect meat his 
age&mdash;nay, some years younger.&nbsp; Did I ever look so 
stupid: so &ldquo;gaumless,&rdquo; as Joseph calls it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worse,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;because more sullen 
with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a pleasure in him,&rsquo; he continued, 
reflecting aloud.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has satisfied my 
expectations.&nbsp; If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it 
half so much.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s no fool; and I can sympathise 
with all his feelings, having felt them myself.&nbsp; I know what
he suffers now, for instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning 
of what he shall suffer, though.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;ll never be 
able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness and ignorance.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got him faster than his scoundrel of a father secured 
me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ve taught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly 
and weak.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think Hindley would be proud of 
his son, if he could see him? almost as proud as I am of 
mine.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s this difference; one is gold put to
the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to ape a 
service of silver.&nbsp; <i>Mine</i> has nothing valuable about 
it; yet I shall have the merit of making it go as far as such 
poor stuff can go.&nbsp; <i>His</i> had first-rate qualities, and
they are lost: rendered worse than unavailing.&nbsp; I have 
nothing to regret; he would have more than any but I are aware 
of.&nbsp; And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of 
me!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll own that I&rsquo;ve outmatched Hindley 
there.&nbsp; If the dead villain could rise from his grave to 
abuse me for his offspring&rsquo;s wrongs, I should have the fun 
of seeing the said offspring fight him back again, indignant that
he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the 
world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea.&nbsp; I made
no reply, because I saw that he expected none.&nbsp; Meantime, 
our young companion, who sat too removed from us to hear what was
said, began to evince symptoms of uneasiness, probably repenting 
that he had denied himself the treat of Catherine&rsquo;s society
for fear of a little fatigue.&nbsp; His father remarked the 
restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand 
irresolutely extended towards his cap.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get up, you idle boy!&rsquo; he exclaimed, with assumed
heartiness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Away after them! they are just at the corner, by the 
stand of hives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth.&nbsp; The 
lattice was open, and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring
of her unsociable attendant what was that inscription over the 
door? Hareton stared up, and scratched his head like a true 
clown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s some damnable writing,&rsquo; he 
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot read it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t read it?&rsquo; cried Catherine; &lsquo;I 
can read it: it&rsquo;s English.&nbsp; But I want to know why it 
is there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had 
exhibited.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He does not know his letters,&rsquo; he said to his 
cousin.&nbsp; &lsquo;Could you believe in the existence of such a
colossal dunce?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he all as he should be?&rsquo; asked Miss Cathy, 
seriously; &lsquo;or is he simple: not right?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
questioned him twice now, and each time he looked so stupid I 
think he does not understand me.&nbsp; I can hardly understand 
him, I&rsquo;m sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; 
who certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that 
moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter but laziness; is 
there, Earnshaw?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;My cousin fancies 
you are an idiot.&nbsp; There you experience the consequence of 
scorning &ldquo;book-larning,&rdquo; as you would say.&nbsp; Have
you noticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire 
pronunciation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, where the devil is the use on&rsquo;t?&rsquo; 
growled Hareton, more ready in answering his daily 
companion.&nbsp; He was about to enlarge further, but the two 
youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss 
being delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk 
to matter of amusement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?&rsquo; 
tittered Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Papa told you not to say any bad 
words, and you can&rsquo;t open your mouth without one.&nbsp; Do 
try to behave like a gentleman, now do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If thou weren&rsquo;t more a lass than a lad, I&rsquo;d
fell thee this minute, I would; pitiful lath of a crater!&rsquo; 
retorted the angry boor, retreating, while his face burnt with 
mingled rage and mortification! for he was conscious of being 
insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as 
I, smiled when he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a 
look of singular aversion on the flippant pair, who remained 
chattering in the door-way: the boy finding animation enough 
while discussing Hareton&rsquo;s faults and deficiencies, and 
relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl relishing his 
pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the ill-nature 
they evinced.&nbsp; I began to dislike, more than to 
compassionate Linton, and to excuse his father in some measure 
for holding him cheap.</p>
<p>We stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away 
sooner; but happily my master had not quitted his apartment, and 
remained ignorant of our prolonged absence.&nbsp; As we walked 
home, I would fain have enlightened my charge on the characters 
of the people we had quitted: but she got it into her head that I
was prejudiced against them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;you take papa&rsquo;s 
side, Ellen: you are partial I know; or else you wouldn&rsquo;t 
have cheated me so many years into the notion that Linton lived a
long way from here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m really extremely angry; only 
I&rsquo;m so pleased I can&rsquo;t show it!&nbsp; But you must 
hold your tongue about <i>my</i> uncle; he&rsquo;s my uncle, 
remember; and I&rsquo;ll scold papa for quarrelling with 
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to 
convince her of her mistake.&nbsp; She did not mention the visit 
that night, because she did not see Mr. Linton.&nbsp; Next day it
all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and still I was not altogether
sorry: I thought the burden of directing and warning would be 
more efficiently borne by him than me.&nbsp; But he was too timid
in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun 
connection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked
good reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted 
will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa!&rsquo; she exclaimed, after the morning&rsquo;s 
salutations, &lsquo;guess whom I saw yesterday, in my walk on the
moors.&nbsp; Ah, papa, you started! you&rsquo;ve not done right, 
have you, now?&nbsp; I saw&mdash;but listen, and you shall hear 
how I found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and 
yet pretended to pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always 
disappointed about Linton&rsquo;s coming back!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its 
consequences; and my master, though he cast more than one 
reproachful look at me, said nothing till she had 
concluded.&nbsp; Then he drew her to him, and asked if she knew 
why he had concealed Linton&rsquo;s near neighbourhood from 
her?&nbsp; Could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she
might harmlessly enjoy?</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,&rsquo; she 
answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than 
yours, Cathy?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, it was not because
I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr. Heathcliff dislikes 
me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong and ruin 
those he hates, if they give him the slightest opportunity.&nbsp;
I knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your 
cousin without being brought into contact with him; and I knew he
would detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing
else, I took precautions that you should not see Linton 
again.&nbsp; I meant to explain this some time as you grew older,
and I&rsquo;m sorry I delayed it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,&rsquo; 
observed Catherine, not at all convinced; &lsquo;and he 
didn&rsquo;t object to our seeing each other: he said I might 
come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell you, 
because you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him 
for marrying aunt Isabella.&nbsp; And you won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; 
<i>You</i> are the one to be blamed: he is willing to let us be 
friends, at least; Linton and I; and you are not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her
uncle-in-law&rsquo;s evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his
conduct to Isabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights 
became his property.&nbsp; He could not bear to discourse long 
upon the topic; for though he spoke little of it, he still felt 
the same horror and detestation of his ancient enemy that had 
occupied his heart ever since Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;She might have been living yet, if it had not been for 
him!&rsquo; was his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes,
Heathcliff seemed a murderer.&nbsp; Miss Cathy&mdash;conversant 
with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of disobedience, 
injustice, and passion, arising from hot temper and 
thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day they were 
committed&mdash;was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could 
brood on and cover revenge for years, and deliberately prosecute 
its plans without a visitation of remorse.&nbsp; She appeared so 
deeply impressed and shocked at this new view of human 
nature&mdash;excluded from all her studies and all her ideas till
now&mdash;that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the 
subject.&nbsp; He merely added: &lsquo;You will know hereafter, 
darling, why I wish you to avoid his house and family; now return
to your old employments and amusements, and think no more about 
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her 
lessons for a couple of hours, according to custom; then she 
accompanied him into the grounds, and the whole day passed as 
usual: but in the evening, when she had retired to her room, and 
I went to help her to undress, I found her crying, on her knees 
by the bedside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, fie, silly child!&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;If you had any real griefs you&rsquo;d be ashamed to waste
a tear on this little contrariety.&nbsp; You never had one shadow
of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine.&nbsp; Suppose, for a 
minute, that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in 
the world: how would you feel, then?&nbsp; Compare the present 
occasion with such an affliction as that, and be thankful for the
friends you have, instead of coveting more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not crying for myself, Ellen,&rsquo; she 
answered, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s for him.&nbsp; He expected to see me 
again to-morrow, and there he&rsquo;ll be so disappointed: and 
he&rsquo;ll wait for me, and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t 
come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;do you imagine he has 
thought as much of you as you have of him?&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t he 
Hareton for a companion?&nbsp; Not one in a hundred would weep at
losing a relation they had just seen twice, for two 
afternoons.&nbsp; Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble 
himself no further about you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot 
come?&rsquo; she asked, rising to her feet.&nbsp; &lsquo;And just
send those books I promised to lend him?&nbsp; His books are not 
as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them extremely, when I 
told him how interesting they were.&nbsp; May I not, 
Ellen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed! no, indeed!&rsquo; replied I with 
decision.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then he would write to you, and 
there&rsquo;d never be an end of it.&nbsp; No, Miss Catherine, 
the acquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I
shall see that it is done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how can one little note&mdash;?&rsquo; she 
recommenced, putting on an imploring countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; I interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
not begin with your little notes.&nbsp; Get into bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would 
not kiss her good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her 
door, in great displeasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned 
softly, and lo! there was Miss standing at the table with a bit 
of blank paper before her and a pencil in her hand, which she 
guiltily slipped out of sight on my entrance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get nobody to take that, Catherine,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;if you write it; and at present I shall put out 
your candle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a 
slap on my hand and a petulant &lsquo;cross thing!&rsquo;&nbsp; I
then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one of her 
worst, most peevish humours.&nbsp; The letter was finished and 
forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came from the 
village; but that I didn&rsquo;t learn till some time 
afterwards.&nbsp; Weeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her 
temper; though she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners 
by herself and often, if I came near her suddenly while reading, 
she would start and bend over the book, evidently desirous to 
hide it; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond 
the leaves.&nbsp; She also got a trick of coming down early in 
the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she were 
expecting the arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in
a cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, 
and whose key she took special care to remove when she left 
it.</p>
<p>One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the 
playthings and trinkets which recently formed its contents were 
transmuted into bits of folded paper.&nbsp; My curiosity and 
suspicions were roused; I determined to take a peep at her 
mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and my master 
were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily found among my house 
keys one that would fit the lock.&nbsp; Having opened, I emptied 
the whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to 
examine at leisure in my own chamber.&nbsp; Though I could not 
but suspect, I was still surprised to discover that they were a 
mass of correspondence&mdash;daily almost, it must have 
been&mdash;from Linton Heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded
by her.&nbsp; The earlier dated were embarrassed and short; 
gradually, however, they expanded into copious love-letters, 
foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet with 
touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more 
experienced source.&nbsp; Some of them struck me as singularly 
odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong 
feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a 
schoolboy might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart.&nbsp; 
Whether they satisfied Cathy I don&rsquo;t know; but they 
appeared very worthless trash to me.&nbsp; After turning over as 
many as I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set 
them aside, relocking the vacant drawer.</p>
<p>Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and 
visited the kitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival
of a certain little boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can,
she tucked something into his jacket pocket, and plucked 
something out.&nbsp; I went round by the garden, and laid wait 
for the messenger; who fought valorously to defend his trust, and
we spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in abstracting the 
epistle; and, threatening serious consequences if he did not look
sharp home, I remained under the wall and perused Miss 
Cathy&rsquo;s affectionate composition.&nbsp; It was more simple 
and more eloquent than her cousin&rsquo;s: very pretty and very 
silly.&nbsp; I shook my head, and went meditating into the 
house.&nbsp; The day being wet, she could not divert herself with
rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her morning 
studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer.&nbsp; Her 
father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a 
bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window-curtain, 
keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings.&nbsp; Never did
any bird flying back to a plundered nest, which it had left 
brimful of chirping young ones, express more complete despair, in
its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her single 
&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; and the change that transfigured her late happy
countenance.&nbsp; Mr. Linton looked up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter, love?&nbsp; Have you hurt 
yourself?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>His tone and look assured her <i>he</i> had not been the 
discoverer of the hoard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, papa!&rsquo; she gasped.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ellen! Ellen!
come up-stairs&mdash;I&rsquo;m sick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Ellen! you have got them,&rsquo; she commenced 
immediately, dropping on her knees, when we were enclosed 
alone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, give them to me, and I&rsquo;ll never, 
never do so again!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell papa.&nbsp; You have 
not told papa, Ellen? say you have not?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been 
exceedingly naughty, but I won&rsquo;t do it any more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So,&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;Miss Catherine, you are 
tolerably far on, it seems: you may well be ashamed of 
them!&nbsp; A fine bundle of trash you study in your leisure 
hours, to be sure: why, it&rsquo;s good enough to be 
printed!&nbsp; And what do you suppose the master will think when
I display it before him?&nbsp; I hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t shown it 
yet, but you needn&rsquo;t imagine I shall keep your ridiculous 
secrets.&nbsp; For shame! and you must have led the way in 
writing such absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning,
I&rsquo;m certain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; sobbed 
Cathy, fit to break her heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t once 
think of loving him till&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Loving</i>!&rsquo; cried I, as scornfully as I could
utter the word.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Loving</i>!&nbsp; Did anybody 
ever hear the like!&nbsp; I might just as well talk of loving the
miller who comes once a year to buy our corn.&nbsp; Pretty 
loving, indeed! and both times together you have seen Linton 
hardly four hours in your life!&nbsp; Now here is the babyish 
trash.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going with it to the library; and 
we&rsquo;ll see what your father says to such 
<i>loving</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sprang at her precious epistles, but I hold them above my 
head; and then she poured out further frantic entreaties that I 
would burn them&mdash;do anything rather than show them.&nbsp; 
And being really fully as much inclined to laugh as 
scold&mdash;for I esteemed it all girlish vanity&mdash;I at 
length relented in a measure, and asked,&mdash;&lsquo;If I 
consent to burn them, will you promise faithfully neither to send
nor receive a letter again, nor a book (for I perceive you have 
sent him books), nor locks of hair, nor rings, nor 
playthings?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t send playthings,&rsquo; cried Catherine,
her pride overcoming her shame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor anything at all, then, my lady?&rsquo; I 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Unless you will, here I go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I promise, Ellen!&rsquo; she cried, catching my 
dress.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, put them in the fire, do, do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the 
sacrifice was too painful to be borne.&nbsp; She earnestly 
supplicated that I would spare her one or two.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton&rsquo;s 
sake!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in 
from an angle, and the flame curled up the chimney.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will have one, you cruel wretch!&rsquo; she screamed,
darting her hand into the fire, and drawing forth some 
half-consumed fragments, at the expense of her fingers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well&mdash;and I will have some to exhibit to 
papa!&rsquo;&nbsp; I answered, shaking back the rest into the 
bundle, and turning anew to the door.</p>
<p>She emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned
me to finish the immolation.&nbsp; It was done; I stirred up the 
ashes, and interred them under a shovelful of coals; and she 
mutely, and with a sense of intense injury, retired to her 
private apartment.&nbsp; I descended to tell my master that the 
young lady&rsquo;s qualm of sickness was almost gone, but I 
judged it best for her to lie down a while.&nbsp; She 
wouldn&rsquo;t dine; but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red 
about the eyes, and marvellously subdued in outward aspect.&nbsp;
Next morning I answered the letter by a slip of paper, inscribed,
&lsquo;Master Heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to 
Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, 
henceforth, the little boy came with vacant pockets.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>Summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past 
Michaelmas, but the harvest was late that year, and a few of our 
fields were still uncleared.&nbsp; Mr. Linton and his daughter 
would frequently walk out among the reapers; at the carrying of 
the last sheaves they stayed till dusk, and the evening happening
to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad cold, that settled 
obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors throughout the
whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.</p>
<p>Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been 
considerably sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her 
father insisted on her reading less, and taking more 
exercise.&nbsp; She had his companionship no longer; I esteemed 
it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible, with mine: an 
inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or three 
hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her 
footsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable than 
his.</p>
<p>On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of 
November&mdash;a fresh watery afternoon, when the turf and paths 
were rustling with moist, withered leaves, and the cold blue sky 
was half hidden by clouds&mdash;dark grey streamers, rapidly 
mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain&mdash;I 
requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was 
certain of showers.&nbsp; She refused; and I unwillingly donned a
cloak, and took my umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the 
bottom of the park: a formal walk which she generally affected if
low-spirited&mdash;and that she invariably was when Mr. Edgar had
been worse than ordinary, a thing never known from his 
confession, but guessed both by her and me from his increased 
silence and the melancholy of his countenance.&nbsp; She went 
sadly on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill 
wind might well have tempted her to race.&nbsp; And often, from 
the side of my eye, I could detect her raising a hand, and 
brushing something off her cheek.&nbsp; I gazed round for a means
of diverting her thoughts.&nbsp; On one side of the road rose a 
high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their roots
half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for 
the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly 
horizontal.&nbsp; In summer Miss Catherine delighted to climb 
along these trunks, and sit in the branches, swinging twenty feet
above the ground; and I, pleased with her agility and her light, 
childish heart, still considered it proper to scold every time I 
caught her at such an elevation, but so that she knew there was 
no necessity for descending.&nbsp; From dinner to tea she would 
lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing nothing except singing old
songs&mdash;my nursery lore&mdash;to herself, or watching the 
birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones to fly: or
nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming, happier 
than words can express.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look, Miss!&rsquo; I exclaimed, pointing to a nook 
under the roots of one twisted tree.&nbsp; &lsquo;Winter is not 
here yet.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a little flower up yonder, the last
bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those turf steps
in July with a lilac mist.&nbsp; Will you clamber up, and pluck 
it to show to papa?&rsquo;&nbsp; Cathy stared a long time at the 
lonely blossom trembling in its earthy shelter, and replied, at 
length&mdash;&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll not touch it: but it looks 
melancholy, does it not, Ellen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I observed, &lsquo;about as starved and 
suckless as you your cheeks are bloodless; let us take hold of 
hands and run.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re so low, I daresay I shall keep 
up with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she repeated, and continued sauntering on, 
pausing at intervals to muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of 
blanched grass, or a fungus spreading its bright orange among the
heaps of brown foliage; and, ever and anon, her hand was lifted 
to her averted face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine, why are you crying, love?&rsquo; I asked, 
approaching and putting my arm over her shoulder.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t cry because papa has a cold; be thankful
it is nothing worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was 
stifled by sobs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it will be something worse,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am 
by myself?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t forget your words, Ellen; they are
always in my ear.&nbsp; How life will be changed, how dreary the 
world will be, when papa and you are dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None can tell whether you won&rsquo;t die before 
us,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s wrong to anticipate
evil.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll hope there are years and years to come 
before any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly
forty-five.&nbsp; My mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to 
the last.&nbsp; And suppose Mr. Linton I were spared till he saw 
sixty, that would be more years than you have counted, 
Miss.&nbsp; And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above
twenty years beforehand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,&rsquo; she 
remarked, gazing up with timid hope to seek further 
consolation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,&rsquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;She wasn&rsquo;t as happy as Master: she 
hadn&rsquo;t as much to live for.&nbsp; All you need do, is to 
wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you 
cheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that,
Cathy!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not disguise but you might kill him if 
you were wild and reckless, and cherished a foolish, fanciful 
affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him 
in his grave; and allowed him to discover that you fretted over 
the separation he has judged it expedient to make.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fret about nothing on earth except papa&rsquo;s 
illness,&rsquo; answered my companion.&nbsp; &lsquo;I care for 
nothing in comparison with papa.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll 
never&mdash;never&mdash;oh, never, while I have my senses, do an 
act or say a word to vex him.&nbsp; I love him better than 
myself, Ellen; and I know it by this: I pray every night that I 
may live after him; because I would rather be miserable than that
he should be: that proves I love him better than 
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good words,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;But deeds 
must prove it also; and after he is well, remember you 
don&rsquo;t forget resolutions formed in the hour of 
fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my
young lady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated
herself on the top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips
that bloomed scarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose 
trees shadowing the highway side: the lower fruit had 
disappeared, but only birds could touch the upper, except from 
Cathy&rsquo;s present station.&nbsp; In stretching to pull them, 
her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed 
scrambling down to recover it.&nbsp; I bid her be cautious lest 
she got a fall, and she nimbly disappeared.&nbsp; But the return 
was no such easy matter: the stones were smooth and neatly 
cemented, and the rose-bushes and black-berry stragglers could 
yield no assistance in re-ascending.&nbsp; I, like a fool, 
didn&rsquo;t recollect that, till I heard her laughing and 
exclaiming&mdash;&lsquo;Ellen! you&rsquo;ll have to fetch the 
key, or else I must run round to the porter&rsquo;s lodge.&nbsp; 
I can&rsquo;t scale the ramparts on this side!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay where you are,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;I have my
bundle of keys in my pocket: perhaps I may manage to open it; if 
not, I&rsquo;ll go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the 
door, while I tried all the large keys in succession.&nbsp; I had
applied the last, and found that none would do; so, repeating my 
desire that she would remain there, I was about to hurry home as 
fast as I could, when an approaching sound arrested me.&nbsp; It 
was the trot of a horse; Cathy&rsquo;s dance stopped also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is that?&rsquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen, I wish you could open the door,&rsquo; whispered
back my companion, anxiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho, Miss Linton!&rsquo; cried a deep voice (the 
rider&rsquo;s), &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to meet you.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to 
ask and obtain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t speak to you, Mr. 
Heathcliff,&rsquo; answered Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Papa says you
are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says 
the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is nothing to the purpose,&rsquo; said 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; (He it was.)&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t hate my
son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand your 
attention.&nbsp; Yes; you have cause to blush.&nbsp; Two or three
months since, were you not in the habit of writing to Linton? 
making love in play, eh?&nbsp; You deserved, both of you, 
flogging for that!&nbsp; You especially, the elder; and less 
sensitive, as it turns out.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got your letters, 
and if you give me any pertness I&rsquo;ll send them to your 
father.&nbsp; I presume you grew weary of the amusement and 
dropped it, didn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Well, you dropped Linton with
it into a Slough of Despond.&nbsp; He was in earnest: in love, 
really.&nbsp; As true as I live, he&rsquo;s dying for you; 
breaking his heart at your fickleness: not figuratively, but 
actually.&nbsp; Though Hareton has made him a standing jest for 
six weeks, and I have used more serious measures, and attempted 
to frighten him out of his idiotcy, he gets worse daily; and 
he&rsquo;ll be under the sod before summer, unless you restore 
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?&rsquo; 
I called from the inside.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray ride on!&nbsp; How 
can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods?&nbsp; Miss 
Cathy, I&rsquo;ll knock the lock off with a stone: you 
won&rsquo;t believe that vile nonsense.&nbsp; You can feel in 
yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a 
stranger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,&rsquo; 
muttered the detected villain.&nbsp; &lsquo;Worthy Mrs. Dean, I 
like you, but I don&rsquo;t like your double-dealing,&rsquo; he 
added aloud.&nbsp; &lsquo;How could <i>you</i> lie so glaringly 
as to affirm I hated the &ldquo;poor child&rdquo;? and invent 
bugbear stories to terrify her from my door-stones?&nbsp; 
Catherine Linton (the very name warms me), my bonny lass, I shall
be from home all this week; go and see if have not spoken truth: 
do, there&rsquo;s a darling!&nbsp; Just imagine your father in my
place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your 
careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when 
your father himself entreated him; and don&rsquo;t, from pure 
stupidity, fall into the same error.&nbsp; I swear, on my 
salvation, he&rsquo;s going to his grave, and none but you can 
save him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lock gave way and I issued out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I swear Linton is dying,&rsquo; repeated Heathcliff, 
looking hard at me.&nbsp; &lsquo;And grief and disappointment are
hastening his death.&nbsp; Nelly, if you won&rsquo;t let her go, 
you can walk over yourself.&nbsp; But I shall not return till 
this time next week; and I think your master himself would 
scarcely object to her visiting her cousin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said I, taking Cathy by the arm and 
half forcing her to re-enter; for she lingered, viewing with 
troubled eyes the features of the speaker, too stern to express 
his inward deceit.</p>
<p>He pushed his horse close, and, bending down, 
observed&mdash;&lsquo;Miss Catherine, I&rsquo;ll own to you that 
I have little patience with Linton; and Hareton and Joseph have 
less.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll own that he&rsquo;s with a harsh 
set.&nbsp; He pines for kindness, as well as love; and a kind 
word from you would be his best medicine.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind 
Mrs. Dean&rsquo;s cruel cautions; but be generous, and contrive 
to see him.&nbsp; He dreams of you day and night, and cannot be 
persuaded that you don&rsquo;t hate him, since you neither write 
nor call.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened 
lock in holding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge 
underneath: for the rain began to drive through the moaning 
branches of the trees, and warned us to avoid delay.&nbsp; Our 
hurry prevented any comment on the encounter with Heathcliff, as 
we stretched towards home; but I divined instinctively that 
Catherine&rsquo;s heart was clouded now in double darkness.&nbsp;
Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she evidently 
regarded what she had heard as every syllable true.</p>
<p>The master had retired to rest before we came in.&nbsp; Cathy 
stole to his room to inquire how he was; he had fallen 
asleep.&nbsp; She returned, and asked me to sit with her in the 
library.&nbsp; We took our tea together; and afterwards she lay 
down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she was 
weary.&nbsp; I got a book, and pretended to read.&nbsp; As soon 
as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her
silent weeping: it appeared, at present, her favourite 
diversion.&nbsp; I suffered her to enjoy it a while; then I 
expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr. Heathcliff&rsquo;s 
assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would 
coincide.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t skill to counteract 
the effect his account had produced: it was just what he 
intended.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may be right, Ellen,&rsquo; she answered; 
&lsquo;but I shall never feel at ease till I know.&nbsp; And I 
must tell Linton it is not my fault that I don&rsquo;t write, and
convince him that I shall not change.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What use were anger and protestations against her silly 
credulity?&nbsp; We parted that night&mdash;hostile; but next day
beheld me on the road to Wuthering Heights, by the side of my 
wilful young mistress&rsquo;s pony.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t bear 
to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected countenance, and
heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that Linton himself 
might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the tale was 
founded on fact.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>The rainy night had ushered in a misty morning&mdash;half 
frost, half drizzle&mdash;and temporary brooks crossed our 
path&mdash;gurgling from the uplands.&nbsp; My feet were 
thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly the humour suited
for making the most of these disagreeable things.&nbsp; We 
entered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether 
Mr. Heathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in 
his own affirmation.</p>
<p>Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a 
roaring fire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling 
with large pieces of toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe 
in his mouth.&nbsp; Catherine ran to the hearth to warm 
herself.&nbsp; I asked if the master was in?&nbsp; My question 
remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had grown
deaf, and repeated it louder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Na&mdash;ay!&rsquo; he snarled, or rather screamed 
through his nose.&nbsp; &lsquo;Na&mdash;ay! yah muh goa back 
whear yah coom frough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joseph!&rsquo; cried a peevish voice, simultaneously 
with me, from the inner room.&nbsp; &lsquo;How often am I to call
you?&nbsp; There are only a few red ashes now.&nbsp; Joseph! come
this moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared 
he had no ear for this appeal.&nbsp; The housekeeper and Hareton 
were invisible; one gone on an errand, and the other at his work,
probably.&nbsp; We knew Linton&rsquo;s tones, and entered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I hope you&rsquo;ll die in a garret, starved to 
death!&rsquo; said the boy, mistaking our approach for that of 
his negligent attendant.</p>
<p>He stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that you, Miss Linton?&rsquo; he said, raising his 
head from the arm of the great chair, in which he reclined.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No&mdash;don&rsquo;t kiss me: it takes my breath.&nbsp; 
Dear me!&nbsp; Papa said you would call,&rsquo; continued he, 
after recovering a little from Catherine&rsquo;s embrace; while 
she stood by looking very contrite.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you shut 
the door, if you please? you left it open; and those&mdash;those 
<i>detestable</i> creatures won&rsquo;t bring coals to the 
fire.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so cold!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful 
myself.&nbsp; The invalid complained of being covered with ashes;
but he had a tiresome cough, and looked feverish and ill, so I 
did not rebuke his temper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Linton,&rsquo; murmured Catherine, when his 
corrugated brow relaxed, &lsquo;are you glad to see me?&nbsp; Can
I do you any good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come before?&rsquo; he 
asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;You should have come, instead of 
writing.&nbsp; It tired me dreadfully writing those long 
letters.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d far rather have talked to you.&nbsp; 
Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor anything else.&nbsp; I 
wonder where Zillah is!&nbsp; Will you&rsquo; (looking at me) 
&lsquo;step into the kitchen and see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had received no thanks for my other service; and being 
unwilling to run to and fro at his behest, I 
replied&mdash;&lsquo;Nobody is out there but Joseph.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to drink,&rsquo; he exclaimed fretfully, turning
away.&nbsp; &lsquo;Zillah is constantly gadding off to Gimmerton 
since papa went: it&rsquo;s miserable!&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m 
obliged to come down here&mdash;they resolved never to hear me 
up-stairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is your father attentive to you, Master 
Heathcliff?&rsquo; I asked, perceiving Catherine to be checked in
her friendly advances.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Attentive?&nbsp; He makes them a little more attentive 
at least,&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;The wretches!&nbsp; Do 
you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton laughs at me!&nbsp; I 
hate him! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious 
beings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher
in the dresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it.&nbsp; He bid 
her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table; and having
swallowed a small portion, appeared more tranquil, and said she 
was very kind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And are you glad to see me?&rsquo; asked she, 
reiterating her former question and pleased to detect the faint 
dawn of a smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s something new to hear a 
voice like yours!&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I have been
vexed, because you wouldn&rsquo;t come.&nbsp; And papa swore it 
was owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless 
thing; and said you despised me; and if he had been in my place, 
he would be more the master of the Grange than your father by 
this time.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t despise me, do you, 
Miss&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,&rsquo; 
interrupted my young lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;Despise you?&nbsp; 
No!&nbsp; Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than anybody 
living.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I 
dare not come when he returns: will he stay away many 
days?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not many,&rsquo; answered Linton; &lsquo;but he goes on
to the moors frequently, since the shooting season commenced; and
you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence.&nbsp; Do 
say you will.&nbsp; I think I should not be peevish with you: 
you&rsquo;d not provoke me, and you&rsquo;d always be ready to 
help me, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Catherine, stroking his long soft 
hair: &lsquo;if I could only get papa&rsquo;s consent, I&rsquo;d 
spend half my time with you.&nbsp; Pretty Linton!&nbsp; I wish 
you were my brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then you would like me as well as your 
father?&rsquo; observed he, more cheerfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;But 
papa says you would love me better than him and all the world, if
you were my wife; so I&rsquo;d rather you were that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I should never love anybody better than 
papa,&rsquo; she returned gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;And people hate 
their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters and brothers: and 
if you were the latter, you would live with us, and papa would be
as fond of you as he is of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy 
affirmed they did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own 
father&rsquo;s aversion to her aunt.&nbsp; I endeavoured to stop 
her thoughtless tongue.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t succeed till 
everything she knew was out.&nbsp; Master Heathcliff, much 
irritated, asserted her relation was false.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,&rsquo;
she answered pertly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>My</i> papa scorns yours!&rsquo; cried Linton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He calls him a sneaking fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours is a wicked man,&rsquo; retorted Catherine; 
&lsquo;and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he 
says.&nbsp; He must be wicked to have made Aunt Isabella leave 
him as she did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She didn&rsquo;t leave him,&rsquo; said the boy; 
&lsquo;you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t contradict me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She did,&rsquo; cried my young lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you something!&rsquo; said 
Linton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your mother hated your father: now 
then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to 
continue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she loved mine,&rsquo; added he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You little liar!&nbsp; I hate you now!&rsquo; she 
panted, and her face grew red with passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She did! she did!&rsquo; sang Linton, sinking into the 
recess of his chair, and leaning back his head to enjoy the 
agitation of the other disputant, who stood behind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, Master Heathcliff!&rsquo; I said; 
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s your father&rsquo;s tale, too, I 
suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t: you hold your tongue!&rsquo; he 
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;She did, she did, Catherine! she did, she 
did!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and 
caused him to fall against one arm.&nbsp; He was immediately 
seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph.&nbsp; 
It lasted so long that it frightened even me.&nbsp; As to his 
cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the mischief she 
had done: though she said nothing.&nbsp; I held him till the fit 
exhausted itself.&nbsp; Then he thrust me away, and leant his 
head down silently.&nbsp; Catherine quelled her lamentations 
also, took a seat opposite, and looked solemnly into the 
fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?&rsquo; I 
inquired, after waiting ten minutes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish <i>she</i> felt as I do,&rsquo; he replied: 
&lsquo;spiteful, cruel thing!&nbsp; Hareton never touches me: he 
never struck me in his life.&nbsp; And I was better to-day: and 
there&mdash;&rsquo; his voice died in a whimper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t strike you!&rsquo; muttered 
Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion.</p>
<p>He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept 
it up for a quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin
apparently, for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put 
renewed pain and pathos into the inflexions of his voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I hurt you, Linton,&rsquo; she said at 
length, racked beyond endurance.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I 
couldn&rsquo;t have been hurt by that little push, and I had no 
idea that you could, either: you&rsquo;re not much, are you, 
Linton?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let me go home thinking I&rsquo;ve done
you harm.&nbsp; Answer! speak to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t speak to you,&rsquo; he murmured; 
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ve hurt me so that I shall lie awake all night 
choking with this cough.&nbsp; If you had it you&rsquo;d know 
what it was; but <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> be comfortably asleep while 
I&rsquo;m in agony, and nobody near me.&nbsp; I wonder how you 
would like to pass those fearful nights!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he 
began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful 
nights,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it won&rsquo;t be Miss who spoils 
your ease: you&rsquo;d be the same had she never come.&nbsp; 
However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps 
you&rsquo;ll get quieter when we leave you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must I go?&rsquo; asked Catherine dolefully, bending 
over him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you want me to go, Linton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t alter what you&rsquo;ve done,&rsquo; he
replied pettishly, shrinking from her, &lsquo;unless you alter it
for the worse by teasing me into a fever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I must go?&rsquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me alone, at least,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I 
can&rsquo;t bear your talking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a 
tiresome while; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she 
finally made a movement to the door, and I followed.&nbsp; We 
were recalled by a scream.&nbsp; Linton had slid from his seat on
to the hearthstone, and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of 
an indulged plague of a child, determined to be as grievous and 
harassing as it can.&nbsp; I thoroughly gauged his disposition 
from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to attempt 
humouring him.&nbsp; Not so my companion: she ran back in terror,
knelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew 
quiet from lack of breath: by no means from compunction at 
distressing her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall lift him on to the settle,&rsquo; I said, 
&lsquo;and he may roll about as he pleases: we can&rsquo;t stop 
to watch him.&nbsp; I hope you are satisfied, Miss Cathy, that 
you are not the person to benefit him; and that his condition of 
health is not occasioned by attachment to you.&nbsp; Now, then, 
there he is!&nbsp; Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody
by to care for his nonsense, he&rsquo;ll be glad to lie 
still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some 
water; he rejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former,
as if it were a stone or a block of wood.&nbsp; She tried to put 
it more comfortably.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do with that,&rsquo; he said; 
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s not high enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine brought another to lay above it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s too high,&rsquo; murmured the provoking 
thing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How must I arrange it, then?&rsquo; she asked 
despairingly.</p>
<p>He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, 
and converted her shoulder into a support.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be content with the cushion, Master 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; Miss has wasted too much time on you already: 
we cannot remain five minutes longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, we can!&rsquo; replied Cathy.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s good and patient now.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s 
beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will 
to-night, if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I 
dare not come again.&nbsp; Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I
musn&rsquo;t come, if I have hurt you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must come, to cure me,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You ought to come, because you have hurt me: you know you 
have extremely!&nbsp; I was not as ill when you entered as I am 
at present&mdash;was I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you&rsquo;ve made yourself ill by crying and being 
in a passion.&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t do it all,&rsquo; said his 
cousin.&nbsp; &lsquo;However, we&rsquo;ll be friends now.&nbsp; 
And you want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, 
really?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you I did,&rsquo; he replied impatiently.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Sit on the settle and let me lean on your knee.&nbsp; 
That&rsquo;s as mamma used to do, whole afternoons 
together.&nbsp; Sit quite still and don&rsquo;t talk: but you may
sing a song, if you can sing; or you may say a nice long 
interesting ballad&mdash;one of those you promised to teach me; 
or a story.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather have a ballad, though: 
begin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine repeated the longest she could remember.&nbsp; The 
employment pleased both mightily.&nbsp; Linton would have 
another, and after that another, notwithstanding my strenuous 
objections; and so they went on until the clock struck twelve, 
and we heard Hareton in the court, returning for his dinner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here 
to-morrow?&rsquo; asked young Heathcliff, holding her frock as 
she rose reluctantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;nor next day 
neither.&rsquo;&nbsp; She, however, gave a different response 
evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered 
in his ear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!&rsquo; I
commenced, when we were out of the house.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are 
not dreaming of it, are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll take good care,&rsquo; I continued: 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have that lock mended, and you can escape by no
way else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can get over the wall,&rsquo; she said 
laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Grange is not a prison, Ellen, and you
are not my gaoler.&nbsp; And besides, I&rsquo;m almost seventeen:
I&rsquo;m a woman.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m certain Linton would 
recover quickly if he had me to look after him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m 
older than he is, you know, and wiser: less childish, am I 
not?&nbsp; And he&rsquo;ll soon do as I direct him, with some 
slight coaxing.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a pretty little darling when 
he&rsquo;s good.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d make such a pet of him, if he 
were mine.&nbsp; We should, never quarrel, should we after we 
were used to each other?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you like him, 
Ellen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like him!&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;The 
worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its 
teens.&nbsp; Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured, he&rsquo;ll 
not win twenty.&nbsp; I doubt whether he&rsquo;ll see spring, 
indeed.&nbsp; And small loss to his family whenever he drops 
off.&nbsp; And lucky it is for us that his father took him: the 
kinder he was treated, the more tedious and selfish he&rsquo;d 
be.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad you have no chance of having him for a 
husband, Miss Catherine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech.&nbsp; To 
speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s younger than I,&rsquo; she answered, after a
protracted pause of meditation, &lsquo;and he ought to live the 
longest: he will&mdash;he must live as long as I do.&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;s as strong now as when he first came into the north; 
I&rsquo;m positive of that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only a cold that 
ails him, the same as papa has.&nbsp; You say papa will get 
better, and why shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;after all, we 
needn&rsquo;t trouble ourselves; for listen, Miss,&mdash;and 
mind, I&rsquo;ll keep my word,&mdash;if you attempt going to 
Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. 
Linton, and, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin 
must not be revived.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been revived,&rsquo; muttered Cathy, 
sulkily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must not be continued, then,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rsquo; was her reply, and she set off 
at a gallop, leaving me to toil in the rear.</p>
<p>We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master 
supposed we had been wandering through the park, and therefore he
demanded no explanation of our absence.&nbsp; As soon as I 
entered I hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings; but 
sitting such awhile at the Heights had done the mischief.&nbsp; 
On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and during three weeks I
remained incapacitated for attending to my duties: a calamity 
never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am thankful 
to say, since.</p>
<p>My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on 
me, and cheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly
low.&nbsp; It is wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few 
have slighter reasons for complaint than I had.&nbsp; The moment 
Catherine left Mr. Linton&rsquo;s room she appeared at my 
bedside.&nbsp; Her day was divided between us; no amusement 
usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her 
play; and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched.&nbsp; She 
must have had a warm heart, when she loved her father so, to give
so much to me.&nbsp; I said her days were divided between us; but
the master retired early, and I generally needed nothing after 
six o&rsquo;clock, thus the evening was her own.&nbsp; Poor 
thing!&nbsp; I never considered what she did with herself after 
tea.&nbsp; And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me 
good-night, I remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a 
pinkness over her slender fingers, instead of fancying the line 
borrowed from a cold ride across the moors, I laid it to the 
charge of a hot fire in the library.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p>At the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and 
move about the house.&nbsp; And on the first occasion of my 
sitting up in the evening I asked Catherine to read to me, 
because my eyes were weak.&nbsp; We were in the library, the 
master having gone to bed: she consented, rather unwillingly, I 
fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not suit her, I bid 
her please herself in the choice of what she perused.&nbsp; She 
selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily 
about an hour; then came frequent questions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen, are not you tired?&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t you better
lie down now?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be sick, keeping up so long, 
Ellen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, dear, I&rsquo;m not tired,&rsquo; I returned, 
continually.</p>
<p>Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing
her disrelish for her occupation.&nbsp; It changed to yawning, 
and stretching, and&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen, I&rsquo;m tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give over then and talk,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>That was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her 
watch till eight, and finally went to her room, completely 
overdone with sleep; judging by her peevish, heavy look, and the 
constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes.&nbsp; The following 
night she seemed more impatient still; and on the third from 
recovering my company she complained of a headache, and left 
me.&nbsp; I thought her conduct odd; and having remained alone a 
long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were 
better, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of 
up-stairs in the dark.&nbsp; No Catherine could I discover 
up-stairs, and none below.&nbsp; The servants affirmed they had 
not seen her.&nbsp; I listened at Mr. Edgar&rsquo;s door; all was
silence.&nbsp; I returned to her apartment, extinguished my 
candle, and seated myself in the window.</p>
<p>The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the 
ground, and I reflected that she might, possibly, have taken it 
into her head to walk about the garden, for refreshment.&nbsp; I 
did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park; 
but it was not my young mistress: on its emerging into the light,
I recognised one of the grooms.&nbsp; He stood a considerable 
period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds; then 
started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and
reappeared presently, leading Miss&rsquo;s pony; and there she 
was, just dismounted, and walking by its side.&nbsp; The man took
his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable.&nbsp; 
Cathy entered by the casement-window of the drawing-room, and 
glided noiselessly up to where I awaited her.&nbsp; She put the 
door gently too, slipped off her snowy shoes, untied her hat, and
was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage, to lay aside her 
mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself.&nbsp; The 
surprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate 
exclamation, and stood fixed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Miss Catherine,&rsquo; I began, too vividly 
impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold, 
&lsquo;where have you been riding out at this hour?&nbsp; And why
should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?&nbsp; Where have 
you been?&nbsp; Speak!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To the bottom of the park,&rsquo; she stammered.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell a tale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And nowhere else?&rsquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; was the muttered reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Catherine!&rsquo; I cried, sorrowfully.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You know you have been doing wrong, or you wouldn&rsquo;t 
be driven to uttering an untruth to me.&nbsp; That does grieve 
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather be three months ill, than hear you 
frame a deliberate lie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms 
round my neck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Ellen, I&rsquo;m so afraid of you being 
angry,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Promise not to be angry, and
you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not 
scold, whatever her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course;
so she commenced&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and 
I&rsquo;ve never missed going a day since you fell ill; except 
thrice before, and twice after you left your room.&nbsp; I gave 
Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every evening, and to
put her back in the stable: you mustn&rsquo;t scold him either, 
mind.&nbsp; I was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally 
stayed till half-past eight, and then galloped home.&nbsp; It was
not to amuse myself that I went: I was often wretched all the 
time.&nbsp; Now and then I was happy: once in a week 
perhaps.&nbsp; At first, I expected there would be sad work 
persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton: for I had 
engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you 
stayed up-stairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble.&nbsp; 
While Michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the 
afternoon, I got possession of the key, and told him how my 
cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and 
couldn&rsquo;t come to the Grange; and how papa would object to 
my going: and then I negotiated with him about the pony.&nbsp; He
is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get married;
so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library, to 
do what I wished: but I preferred giving him my own, and that 
satisfied him better.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and
Zillah (that is their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a 
good fire, and told us that, as Joseph was out at a 
prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was off with his 
dogs&mdash;robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard 
afterwards&mdash;we might do what we liked.&nbsp; She brought me 
some warm wine and gingerbread, and appeared exceedingly 
good-natured, and Linton sat in the arm-chair, and I in the 
little rocking chair on the hearth-stone, and we laughed and 
talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we planned where we 
would go, and what we would do in summer.&nbsp; I needn&rsquo;t 
repeat that, because you would call it silly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One time, however, we were near quarrelling.&nbsp; He 
said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot July day was lying 
from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the
moors, with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom, and 
the larks singing high up overhead, and the blue sky and bright 
sun shining steadily and cloudlessly.&nbsp; That was his most 
perfect idea of heaven&rsquo;s happiness: mine was rocking in a 
rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white 
clouds flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles,
and blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on 
every side, and the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool 
dusky dells; but close by great swells of long grass undulating 
in waves to the breeze; and woods and sounding water, and the 
whole world awake and wild with joy.&nbsp; He wanted all to lie 
in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and dance in a 
glorious jubilee.&nbsp; I said his heaven would be only half 
alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall 
asleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and 
began to grow very snappish.&nbsp; At last, we agreed to try 
both, as soon as the right weather came; and then we kissed each 
other and were friends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room
with its smooth uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would 
be to play in, if we removed the table; and I asked Linton to 
call Zillah in to help us, and we&rsquo;d have a game at 
blindman&rsquo;s-buff; she should try to catch us: you used to, 
you know, Ellen.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t: there was no pleasure 
in it, he said; but he consented to play at ball with me.&nbsp; 
We found two in a cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and 
hoops, and battledores and shuttlecocks.&nbsp; One was marked C.,
and the other H.; I wished to have the C., because that stood for
Catherine, and the H. might be for Heathcliff, his name; but the 
bran came out of H., and Linton didn&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; I 
beat him constantly: and he got cross again, and coughed, and 
returned to his chair.&nbsp; That night, though, he easily 
recovered his good humour: he was charmed with two or three 
pretty songs&mdash;<i>your</i> songs, Ellen; and when I was 
obliged to go, he begged and entreated me to come the following 
evening; and I promised.&nbsp; Minny and I went flying home as 
light as air; and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet, 
darling cousin, till morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were 
poorly, and partly that I wished my father knew, and approved of 
my excursions: but it was beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as 
I rode on, the gloom cleared.&nbsp; I shall have another happy 
evening, I thought to myself; and what delights me more, my 
pretty Linton will.&nbsp; I trotted up their garden, and was 
turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took
my bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance.&nbsp; He 
patted Minny&rsquo;s neck, and said she was a bonny beast, and 
appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him.&nbsp; I only told 
him to leave my horse alone, or else it would kick him.&nbsp; He 
answered in his vulgar accent, &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do mitch 
hurt if it did;&rdquo; and surveyed its legs with a smile.&nbsp; 
I was half inclined to make it try; however, he moved off to open
the door, and, as he raised the latch, he looked up to the 
inscription above, and said, with a stupid mixture of awkwardness
and elation: &ldquo;Miss Catherine!&nbsp; I can read yon, 
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray
let us hear you&mdash;you <i>are</i> grown clever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the 
name&mdash;&ldquo;Hareton Earnshaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And the figures?&rdquo; I cried, encouragingly, 
perceiving that he came to a dead halt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I cannot tell them yet,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, you dunce!&rdquo; I said, laughing heartily 
at his failure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, 
and a scowl gathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he 
might not join in my mirth: whether it were not pleasant 
familiarity, or what it really was, contempt.&nbsp; I settled his
doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to 
walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him.&nbsp; He 
reddened&mdash;I saw that by the moonlight&mdash;dropped his hand
from the latch, and skulked off, a picture of mortified 
vanity.&nbsp; He imagined himself to be as accomplished as 
Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own name; and was 
marvellously discomfited that I didn&rsquo;t think the 
same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!&rsquo;&mdash;I 
interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall not scold, but I don&rsquo;t 
like your conduct there.&nbsp; If you had remembered that Hareton
was your cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt
how improper it was to behave in that way.&nbsp; At least, it was
praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as 
Linton; and probably he did not learn merely to show off: you had
made him ashamed of his ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he
wished to remedy it and please you.&nbsp; To sneer at his 
imperfect attempt was very bad breeding.&nbsp; Had you been 
brought up in his circumstances, would you be less rude?&nbsp; He
was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were; and 
I&rsquo;m hurt that he should be despised now, because that base 
Heathcliff has treated him so unjustly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Ellen, you won&rsquo;t cry about it, will 
you?&rsquo; she exclaimed, surprised at my earnestness.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But wait, and you shall hear if he conned his A B C to 
please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the 
brute.&nbsp; I entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half 
got up to welcome me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ill to-night, Catherine, love,&rdquo; 
he said; &ldquo;and you must have all the talk, and let me 
listen.&nbsp; Come, and sit by me.&nbsp; I was sure you 
wouldn&rsquo;t break your word, and I&rsquo;ll make you promise 
again, before you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew now that I mustn&rsquo;t tease him, as he was 
ill; and I spoke softly and put no questions, and avoided 
irritating him in any way.&nbsp; I had brought some of my nicest 
books for him: he asked me to read a little of one, and I was 
about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open: having 
gathered venom with reflection.&nbsp; He advanced direct to us, 
seized Linton by the arm, and swung him off the seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Get to thy own room!&rdquo; he said, in a voice 
almost inarticulate with passion; and his face looked swelled and
furious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take her there if she comes to see thee: 
thou shalln&rsquo;t keep me out of this.&nbsp; Begone wi&rsquo; 
ye both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, 
nearly throwing him into the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as
I followed, seemingly longing to knock me down.&nbsp; I was 
afraid for a moment, and I let one volume fall; he kicked it 
after me, and shut us out.&nbsp; I heard a malignant, crackly 
laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious Joseph 
standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I wer sure he&rsquo;d sarve ye out!&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;s a grand lad!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s getten t&rsquo; raight 
sperrit in him!&nbsp; <i>He</i> knaws&mdash;ay, he knaws, as weel
as I do, who sud be t&rsquo; maister yonder&mdash;Ech, ech, 
ech!&nbsp; He made ye skift properly!&nbsp; Ech, ech, 
ech!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Where must we go?&rdquo; I asked of my cousin, 
disregarding the old wretch&rsquo;s mockery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Linton was white and trembling.&nbsp; He was not pretty
then, Ellen: oh, no! he looked frightful; for his thin face and 
large eyes were wrought into an expression of frantic, powerless 
fury.&nbsp; He grasped the handle of the door, and shook it: it 
was fastened inside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t let me in, I&rsquo;ll kill 
you!&mdash;If you don&rsquo;t let me in, I&rsquo;ll kill 
you!&rdquo; he rather shrieked than said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Devil! 
devil!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll kill you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll kill 
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joseph uttered his croaking laugh again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Thear, that&rsquo;s t&rsquo; father!&rdquo; he 
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s father!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve allas 
summut o&rsquo; either side in us.&nbsp; Niver heed, Hareton, 
lad&mdash;dunnut be &lsquo;feard&mdash;he cannot get at 
thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I took hold of Linton&rsquo;s hands, and tried to pull 
him away; but he shrieked so shockingly that I dared not 
proceed.&nbsp; At last his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of
coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and he fell on the 
ground.&nbsp; I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and called 
for Zillah, as loud as I could.&nbsp; She soon heard me: she was 
milking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her
work, she inquired what there was to do?&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t 
breath to explain; dragging her in, I looked about for 
Linton.&nbsp; Earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief he 
had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing 
up-stairs.&nbsp; Zillah and I ascended after him; but he stopped 
me at the top of the steps, and said I shouldn&rsquo;t go in: I 
must go home.&nbsp; I exclaimed that he had killed Linton, and I 
<i>would</i> enter.&nbsp; Joseph locked the door, and declared I 
should do &ldquo;no sich stuff,&rdquo; and asked me whether I 
were &ldquo;bahn to be as mad as him.&rdquo;&nbsp; I stood crying
till the housekeeper reappeared.&nbsp; She affirmed he would be 
better in a bit, but he couldn&rsquo;t do with that shrieking and
din; and she took me, and nearly carried me into the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head!&nbsp; I
sobbed and wept so that my eyes were almost blind; and the 
ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite: presuming 
every now and then to bid me &ldquo;wisht,&rdquo; and denying 
that it was his fault; and, finally, frightened by my assertions 
that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison and 
hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide 
his cowardly agitation.&nbsp; Still, I was not rid of him: when 
at length they compelled me to depart, and I had got some hundred
yards off the premises, he suddenly issued from the shadow of the
road-side, and checked Minny and took hold of me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Miss Catherine, I&rsquo;m ill grieved,&rdquo; he
began, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s rayther too bad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he 
would murder me.&nbsp; He let go, thundering one of his horrid 
curses, and I galloped home more than half out of my senses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t bid you good-night that evening, and I 
didn&rsquo;t go to Wuthering Heights the next: I wished to go 
exceedingly; but I was strangely excited, and dreaded to hear 
that Linton was dead, sometimes; and sometimes shuddered at the 
thought of encountering Hareton.&nbsp; On the third day I took 
courage: at least, I couldn&rsquo;t bear longer suspense, and 
stole off once more.&nbsp; I went at five o&rsquo;clock, and 
walked; fancying I might manage to creep into the house, and up 
to Linton&rsquo;s room, unobserved.&nbsp; However, the dogs gave 
notice of my approach.&nbsp; Zillah received me, and saying 
&ldquo;the lad was mending nicely,&rdquo; showed me into a small,
tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I 
beheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my 
books.&nbsp; But he would neither speak to me nor look at me, 
through a whole hour, Ellen: he has such an unhappy temper.&nbsp;
And what quite confounded me, when he did open his mouth, it was 
to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned the uproar, and 
Hareton was not to blame!&nbsp; Unable to reply, except 
passionately, I got up and walked from the room.&nbsp; He sent 
after me a faint &ldquo;Catherine!&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not reckon
on being answered so: but I wouldn&rsquo;t turn back; and the 
morrow was the second day on which I stayed at home, nearly 
determined to visit him no more.&nbsp; But it was so miserable 
going to bed and getting up, and never hearing anything about 
him, that my resolution melted into air before it was properly 
formed.&nbsp; It had appeared wrong to take the journey once; now
it seemed wrong to refrain.&nbsp; Michael came to ask if he must 
saddle Minny; I said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and considered myself 
doing a duty as she bore me over the hills.&nbsp; I was forced to
pass the front windows to get to the court: it was no use trying 
to conceal my presence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Young master is in the house,&rdquo; said 
Zillah, as she saw me making for the parlour.&nbsp; I went in; 
Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the room directly.&nbsp; 
Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking up to the 
fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be 
true&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;As you don&rsquo;t like me, Linton, and as you 
think I come on purpose to hurt you, and pretend that I do so 
every time, this is our last meeting: let us say good-bye; and 
tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no wish to see me, and that he 
mustn&rsquo;t invent any more falsehoods on the 
subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sit down and take your hat off, 
Catherine,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are so much 
happier than I am, you ought to be better.&nbsp; Papa talks 
enough of my defects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it 
natural I should doubt myself.&nbsp; I doubt whether I am not 
altogether as worthless as he calls me, frequently; and then I 
feel so cross and bitter, I hate everybody!&nbsp; I am worthless,
and bad in temper, and bad in spirit, almost always; and, if you 
choose, you may say good-bye: you&rsquo;ll get rid of an 
annoyance.&nbsp; Only, Catherine, do me this justice: believe 
that if I might be as sweet, and as kind, and as good as you are,
I would be; as willingly, and more so, than as happy and as 
healthy.&nbsp; And believe that your kindness has made me love 
you deeper than if I deserved your love: and though I 
couldn&rsquo;t, and cannot help showing my nature to you, I 
regret it and repent it; and shall regret and repent it till I 
die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive 
him: and, though we should quarrel the next moment, I must 
forgive him again.&nbsp; We were reconciled; but we cried, both 
of us, the whole time I stayed: not entirely for sorrow; yet I 
<i>was</i> sorry Linton had that distorted nature.&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;ll never let his friends be at ease, and he&rsquo;ll 
never be at ease himself!&nbsp; I have always gone to his little 
parlour, since that night; because his father returned the day 
after.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About three times, I think, we have been merry and 
hopeful, as we were the first evening; the rest of my visits were
dreary and troubled: now with his selfishness and spite, and now 
with his sufferings: but I&rsquo;ve learned to endure the former 
with nearly as little resentment as the latter.&nbsp; Mr. 
Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at 
all.&nbsp; Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I 
heard him abusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the 
night before.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell how he knew of it, unless 
he listened.&nbsp; Linton had certainly behaved provokingly: 
however, it was the business of nobody but me, and I interrupted 
Mr. Heathcliff&rsquo;s lecture by entering and telling him 
so.&nbsp; He burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was 
glad I took that view of the matter.&nbsp; Since then, I&rsquo;ve
told Linton he must whisper his bitter things.&nbsp; Now, Ellen, 
you have heard all.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be prevented from going 
to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two people; 
whereas, if you&rsquo;ll only not tell papa, my going need 
disturb the tranquillity of none.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll not tell, 
will you?&nbsp; It will be very heartless, if you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, 
Miss Catherine,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;It requires some 
study; and so I&rsquo;ll leave you to your rest, and go think it 
over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I thought it over aloud, in my master&rsquo;s presence; 
walking straight from her room to his, and relating the whole 
story: with the exception of her conversations with her cousin, 
and any mention of Hareton.&nbsp; Mr. Linton was alarmed and 
distressed, more than he would acknowledge to me.&nbsp; In the 
morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and she 
learnt also that her secret visits were to end.&nbsp; In vain she
wept and writhed against the interdict, and implored her father 
to have pity on Linton: all she got to comfort her was a promise 
that he would write and give him leave to come to the Grange when
he pleased; but explaining that he must no longer expect to see 
Catherine at Wuthering Heights.&nbsp; Perhaps, had he been aware 
of his nephew&rsquo;s disposition and state of health, he would 
have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p>&lsquo;These things happened last winter, sir,&rsquo; said 
Mrs. Dean; &lsquo;hardly more than a year ago.&nbsp; Last winter,
I did not think, at another twelve months&rsquo; end, I should be
amusing a stranger to the family with relating them!&nbsp; Yet, 
who knows how long you&rsquo;ll be a stranger?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
too young to rest always contented, living by yourself; and I 
some way fancy no one could see Catherine Linton and not love 
her.&nbsp; You smile; but why do you look so lively and 
interested when I talk about her? and why have you asked me to 
hang her picture over your fireplace? and why&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop, my good friend!&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;It 
may be very possible that <i>I</i> should love her; but would she
love me?&nbsp; I doubt it too much to venture my tranquillity by 
running into temptation: and then my home is not here.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m of the busy world, and to its arms I must return.&nbsp;
Go on.&nbsp; Was Catherine obedient to her father&rsquo;s 
commands?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was,&rsquo; continued the housekeeper.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Her affection for him was still the chief sentiment in her
heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke in the deep 
tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and 
foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he 
could bequeath to guide her.&nbsp; He said to me, a few days 
afterwards, &ldquo;I wish my nephew would write, Ellen, or 
call.&nbsp; Tell me, sincerely, what you think of him: is he 
changed for the better, or is there a prospect of improvement, as
he grows a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very delicate, sir,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;and scarcely likely to reach manhood: but this I can say, 
he does not resemble his father; and if Miss Catherine had the 
misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond her control: 
unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.&nbsp; However,
master, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to get acquainted with 
him and see whether he would suit her: it wants four years and 
more to his being of age.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Edgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards 
Gimmerton Kirk.&nbsp; It was a misty afternoon, but the February 
sun shone dimly, and we could just distinguish the two fir-trees 
in the yard, and the sparely-scattered gravestones.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve prayed often,&rsquo; he half soliloquised, 
&lsquo;for the approach of what is coming; and now I begin to 
shrink, and fear it.&nbsp; I thought the memory of the hour I 
came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the 
anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, 
weeks, to be carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow!&nbsp; 
Ellen, I&rsquo;ve been very happy with my little Cathy: through 
winter nights and summer days she was a living hope at my 
side.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve been as happy musing by myself among 
those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June
evenings, on the green mound of her mother&rsquo;s grave, and 
wishing&mdash;yearning for the time when I might lie beneath 
it.&nbsp; What can I do for Cathy?&nbsp; How must I quit 
her?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d not care one moment for Linton being 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s son; nor for his taking her from me, if he 
could console her for my loss.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d not care that 
Heathcliff gained his ends, and triumphed in robbing me of my 
last blessing!&nbsp; But should Linton be unworthy&mdash;only a 
feeble tool to his father&mdash;I cannot abandon her to 
him!&nbsp; And, hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit, I 
must persevere in making her sad while I live, and leaving her 
solitary when I die.&nbsp; Darling!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather resign
her to God, and lay her in the earth before me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Resign her to God as it is, sir,&rsquo; I answered, 
&lsquo;and if we should lose you&mdash;which may He 
forbid&mdash;under His providence, I&rsquo;ll stand her friend 
and counsellor to the last.&nbsp; Miss Catherine is a good girl: 
I don&rsquo;t fear that she will go wilfully wrong; and people 
who do their duty are always finally rewarded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, 
though he resumed his walks in the grounds with his 
daughter.&nbsp; To her inexperienced notions, this itself was a 
sign of convalescence; and then his cheek was often flushed, and 
his eyes were bright; she felt sure of his recovering.&nbsp; On 
her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit the churchyard: it was
raining, and I observed&mdash;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll surely not go 
out to-night, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He answered,&mdash;&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll defer it this year a 
little longer.&rsquo;&nbsp; He wrote again to Linton, expressing 
his great desire to see him; and, had the invalid been 
presentable, I&rsquo;ve no doubt his father would have permitted 
him to come.&nbsp; As it was, being instructed, he returned an 
answer, intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at
the Grange; but his uncle&rsquo;s kind remembrance delighted him,
and he hoped to meet him sometimes in his rambles, and personally
to petition that his cousin and he might not remain long so 
utterly divided.</p>
<p>That part of his letter was simple, and probably his 
own.&nbsp; Heathcliff knew he could plead eloquently for 
Catherine&rsquo;s company, then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not ask,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that she may visit
here; but am I never to see her, because my father forbids me to 
go to her home, and you forbid her to come to mine?&nbsp; Do, now
and then, ride with her towards the Heights; and let us exchange 
a few words, in your presence!&nbsp; We have done nothing to 
deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me: you have 
no reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself.&nbsp; Dear uncle! 
send me a kind note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you
please, except at Thrushcross Grange.&nbsp; I believe an 
interview would convince you that my father&rsquo;s character is 
not mine: he affirms I am more your nephew than his son; and 
though I have faults which render me unworthy of Catherine, she 
has excused them, and for her sake, you should also.&nbsp; You 
inquire after my health&mdash;it is better; but while I remain 
cut off from all hope, and doomed to solitude, or the society of 
those who never did and never will like me, how can I be cheerful
and well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant 
his request; because he could not accompany Catherine.&nbsp; He 
said, in summer, perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished 
him to continue writing at intervals, and engaged to give him 
what advice and comfort he was able by letter; being well aware 
of his hard position in his family.&nbsp; Linton complied; and 
had he been unrestrained, would probably have spoiled all by 
filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations: but his 
father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on 
every line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of 
penning his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the 
themes constantly uppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the 
cruel obligation of being held asunder from his friend and love; 
and gently intimated that Mr. Linton must allow an interview 
soon, or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with empty
promises.</p>
<p>Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at 
length persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or
a walk together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on 
the moors nearest the Grange: for June found him still 
declining.&nbsp; Though he had set aside yearly a portion of his 
income for my young lady&rsquo;s fortune, he had a natural desire
that she might retain&mdash;or at least return in a short time 
to&mdash;the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only 
prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no 
idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor 
had any one, I believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no one
saw Master Heathcliff to make report of his condition among 
us.&nbsp; I, for my part, began to fancy my forebodings were 
false, and that he must be actually rallying, when he mentioned 
riding and walking on the moors, and seemed so earnest in 
pursuing his object.&nbsp; I could not picture a father treating 
a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards 
learned Heathcliff had treated him, to compel this apparent 
eagerness: his efforts redoubling the more imminently his 
avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat by 
death.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p>Summer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly 
yielded his assent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set 
out on our first ride to join her cousin.&nbsp; It was a close, 
sultry day: devoid of sunshine, but with a sky too dappled and 
hazy to threaten rain: and our place of meeting had been fixed at
the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.&nbsp; On arriving there, 
however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a messenger, told us 
that,&mdash;&lsquo;Maister Linton wer just o&rsquo; this side 
th&rsquo; Heights: and he&rsquo;d be mitch obleeged to us to gang
on a bit further.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of 
his uncle,&rsquo; I observed: &lsquo;he bid us keep on the Grange
land, and here we are off at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll turn our horses&rsquo; heads round 
when we reach him,&rsquo; answered my companion; &lsquo;our 
excursion shall lie towards home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a 
mile from his own door, we found he had no horse; and we were 
forced to dismount, and leave ours to graze.&nbsp; He lay on the 
heath, awaiting our approach, and did not rise till we came 
within a few yards.&nbsp; Then he walked so feebly, and looked so
pale, that I immediately exclaimed,&mdash;&lsquo;Why, Master 
Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this 
morning.&nbsp; How ill you do look!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she 
changed the ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and 
the congratulation on their long-postponed meeting to an anxious 
inquiry, whether he were worse than usual?</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;better&mdash;better!&rsquo; he panted, 
trembling, and retaining her hand as if he needed its support, 
while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her; the 
hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the 
languid expression they once possessed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you have been worse,&rsquo; persisted his cousin; 
&lsquo;worse than when I saw you last; you are thinner, 
and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rsquo; he interrupted, 
hurriedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is too hot for walking, let us rest 
here.&nbsp; And, in the morning, I often feel sick&mdash;papa 
says I grow so fast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside 
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is something like your paradise,&rsquo; said she, 
making an effort at cheerfulness.&nbsp; &lsquo;You recollect the 
two days we agreed to spend in the place and way each thought 
pleasantest?&nbsp; This is nearly yours, only there are clouds; 
but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer than 
sunshine.&nbsp; Next week, if you can, we&rsquo;ll ride down to 
the Grange Park, and try mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of and he 
had evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of 
conversation.&nbsp; His lack of interest in the subjects she 
started, and his equal incapacity to contribute to her 
entertainment, were so obvious that she could not conceal her 
disappointment.&nbsp; An indefinite alteration had come over his 
whole person and manner.&nbsp; The pettishness that might be 
caressed into fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there 
was less of the peevish temper of a child which frets and teases 
on purpose to be soothed, and more of the self-absorbed 
moroseness of a confirmed invalid, repelling consolation, and 
ready to regard the good-humoured mirth of others as an 
insult.&nbsp; Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he held
it rather a punishment, than a gratification, to endure our 
company; and she made no scruple of proposing, presently, to 
depart.&nbsp; That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his
lethargy, and threw him into a strange state of agitation.&nbsp; 
He glanced fearfully towards the Heights, begging she would 
remain another half-hour, at least.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I think,&rsquo; said Cathy, &lsquo;you&rsquo;d be 
more comfortable at home than sitting here; and I cannot amuse 
you to-day, I see, by my tales, and songs, and chatter: you have 
grown wiser than I, in these six months; you have little taste 
for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse you, I&rsquo;d 
willingly stay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay to rest yourself,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;And, Catherine, don&rsquo;t think or say that I&rsquo;m 
<i>very</i> unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make me
dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for 
me.&nbsp; Tell uncle I&rsquo;m in tolerable health, will 
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him that <i>you</i> say so, 
Linton.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t affirm that you are,&rsquo; 
observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion 
of what was evidently an untruth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And be here again next Thursday,&rsquo; continued he, 
shunning her puzzled gaze.&nbsp; &lsquo;And give him my thanks 
for permitting you to come&mdash;my best thanks, Catherine.&nbsp;
And&mdash;and, if you <i>did</i> meet my father, and he asked you
about me, don&rsquo;t lead him to suppose that I&rsquo;ve been 
extremely silent and stupid: don&rsquo;t look sad and downcast, 
as you are doing&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be angry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I care nothing for his anger,&rsquo; exclaimed Cathy, 
imagining she would be its object.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I do,&rsquo; said her cousin, shuddering.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i> provoke him against me, Catherine, for 
he is very hard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?&rsquo; I 
inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has he grown weary of indulgence, and 
passed from passive to active hatred?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping 
her seat by his side another ten minutes, during which his head 
fell drowsily on his breast, and he uttered nothing except 
suppressed moans of exhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek 
solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing the produce of her 
researches with me: she did not offer them to him, for she saw 
further notice would only weary and annoy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?&rsquo; she whispered in 
my ear, at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell why we should 
stay.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s asleep, and papa will be wanting us 
back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we must not leave him asleep,&rsquo; I answered; 
&lsquo;wait till lie wakes, and be patient.&nbsp; You were mighty
eager to set off, but your longing to see poor Linton has soon 
evaporated!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did <i>he</i> wish to see me?&rsquo; returned 
Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;In his crossest humours, formerly, I 
liked him better than I do in his present curious mood.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s just as if it were a task he was compelled to 
perform&mdash;this interview&mdash;for fear his father should 
scold him.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m hardly going to come to give Mr. 
Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for ordering 
Linton to undergo this penance.&nbsp; And, though I&rsquo;m glad 
he&rsquo;s better in health, I&rsquo;m sorry he&rsquo;s so much 
less pleasant, and so much less affectionate to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think <i>he is</i> better in health, then?&rsquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;because he always made
such a great deal of his sufferings, you know.&nbsp; He is not 
tolerably well, as he told me to tell papa; but he&rsquo;s 
better, very likely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,&rsquo; I 
remarked; &lsquo;I should conjecture him to be far 
worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and
asked if any one had called his name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Catherine; &lsquo;unless in 
dreams.&nbsp; I cannot conceive how you manage to doze out of 
doors, in the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I heard my father,&rsquo; he gasped, glancing
up to the frowning nab above us.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are sure nobody
spoke?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite sure,&rsquo; replied his cousin.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Only Ellen and I were disputing concerning your 
health.&nbsp; Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we 
separated in winter?&nbsp; If you be, I&rsquo;m certain one thing
is not stronger&mdash;your regard for me: speak,&mdash;are 
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tears gushed from Linton&rsquo;s eyes as he answered, 
&lsquo;Yes, yes, I am!&rsquo;&nbsp; And, still under the spell of
the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up and down to detect its 
owner.</p>
<p>Cathy rose.&nbsp; &lsquo;For to-day we must part,&rsquo; she 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I won&rsquo;t conceal that I have been 
sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I&rsquo;ll mention it
to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr. 
Heathcliff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush,&rsquo; murmured Linton; &lsquo;for God&rsquo;s 
sake, hush!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s coming.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he clung to
Catherine&rsquo;s arm, striving to detain her; but at that 
announcement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to 
Minny, who obeyed her like a dog.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be here next Thursday,&rsquo; she cried, 
springing to the saddle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good-bye.&nbsp; Quick, 
Ellen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so 
absorbed was he in anticipating his father&rsquo;s approach.</p>
<p>Before we reached home, Catherine&rsquo;s displeasure softened
into a perplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended 
with vague, uneasy doubts about Linton&rsquo;s actual 
circumstances, physical and social: in which I partook, though I 
counselled her not to say much; for a second journey would make 
us better judges.&nbsp; My master requested an account of our 
ongoings.&nbsp; His nephew&rsquo;s offering of thanks was duly 
delivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also threw 
little light on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide and
what to reveal.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<p>Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the 
henceforth rapid alteration of Edgar Linton&rsquo;s state.&nbsp; 
The havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by 
the inroads of hours.&nbsp; Catherine we would fain have deluded 
yet; but her own quick spirit refused to delude her: it divined 
in secret, and brooded on the dreadful probability, gradually 
ripening into certainty.&nbsp; She had not the heart to mention 
her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her, and 
obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library, 
where her father stopped a short time daily&mdash;the brief 
period he could bear to sit up&mdash;and his chamber, had become 
her whole world.&nbsp; She grudged each moment that did not find 
her bending over his pillow, or seated by his side.&nbsp; Her 
countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my master 
gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a 
happy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope 
that she would not now be left entirely alone after his 
death.</p>
<p>He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let 
fall, that, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would 
resemble him in mind; for Linton&rsquo;s letters bore few or no 
indications of his defective character.&nbsp; And I, through 
pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the error; asking 
myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments 
with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to 
turn to account.</p>
<p>We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden 
afternoon of August: every breath from the hills so full of life,
that it seemed whoever respired it, though dying, might 
revive.&nbsp; Catherine&rsquo;s face was just like the 
landscape&mdash;shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid 
succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was 
more transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for 
even that passing forgetfulness of its cares.</p>
<p>We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected 
before.&nbsp; My young mistress alighted, and told me that, as 
she was resolved to stay a very little while, I had better hold 
the pony and remain on horseback; but I dissented: I 
wouldn&rsquo;t risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a 
minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.&nbsp; Master 
Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion: 
not the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it 
looked more like fear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is late!&rsquo; he said, speaking short and with 
difficulty.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is not your father very ill?&nbsp; I 
thought you wouldn&rsquo;t come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Why</i> won&rsquo;t you be candid?&rsquo; cried 
Catherine, swallowing her greeting.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why cannot you 
say at once you don&rsquo;t want me?&nbsp; It is strange, Linton,
that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose, 
apparently to distress us both, and for no reason 
besides!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half 
ashamed; but his cousin&rsquo;s patience was not sufficient to 
endure this enigmatical behaviour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father <i>is</i> very ill,&rsquo; she said; 
&lsquo;and why am I called from his bedside?&nbsp; Why 
didn&rsquo;t you send to absolve me from my promise, when you 
wished I wouldn&rsquo;t keep it?&nbsp; Come!&nbsp; I desire an 
explanation: playing and trifling are completely banished out of 
my mind; and I can&rsquo;t dance attendance on your affectations 
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My affectations!&rsquo; he murmured; &lsquo;what are 
they?&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Catherine, don&rsquo;t look 
so angry!&nbsp; Despise me as much as you please; I am a 
worthless, cowardly wretch: I can&rsquo;t be scorned enough; but 
I&rsquo;m too mean for your anger.&nbsp; Hate my father, and 
spare me for contempt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; cried Catherine in a passion.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Foolish, silly boy!&nbsp; And there! he trembles: as if I 
were really going to touch him!&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t bespeak 
contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your 
service.&nbsp; Get off!&nbsp; I shall return home: it is folly 
dragging you from the hearth-stone, and pretending&mdash;what do 
we pretend?&nbsp; Let go my frock!&nbsp; If I pitied you for 
crying and looking so very frightened, you should spurn such 
pity.&nbsp; Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct 
is.&nbsp; Rise, and don&rsquo;t degrade yourself into an abject 
reptile&mdash;<i>don&rsquo;t</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had 
thrown his nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed 
with exquisite terror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; he sobbed, &lsquo;I cannot bear it!&nbsp; 
Catherine, Catherine, I&rsquo;m a traitor, too, and I dare not 
tell you!&nbsp; But leave me, and I shall be killed!&nbsp; 
<i>Dear</i> Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have 
said you loved me, and if you did, it wouldn&rsquo;t harm 
you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll not go, then? kind, sweet, good 
Catherine!&nbsp; And perhaps you <i>will</i> consent&mdash;and 
he&rsquo;ll let me die with you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to 
raise him.&nbsp; The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame
her vexation, and she grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Consent to what?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;To 
stay! tell me the meaning of this strange talk, and I will.&nbsp;
You contradict your own words, and distract me!&nbsp; Be calm and
frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your heart.&nbsp; 
You wouldn&rsquo;t injure me, Linton, would you?&nbsp; You 
wouldn&rsquo;t let any enemy hurt me, if you could prevent 
it?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll believe you are a coward, for yourself, but 
not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But my father threatened me,&rsquo; gasped the boy, 
clasping his attenuated fingers, &lsquo;and I dread him&mdash;I 
dread him!&nbsp; I <i>dare</i> not tell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, well!&rsquo; said Catherine, with scornful 
compassion, &lsquo;keep your secret: <i>I&rsquo;m</i> no 
coward.&nbsp; Save yourself: I&rsquo;m not afraid!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing 
her supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak 
out.&nbsp; I was cogitating what the mystery might be, and 
determined Catherine should never suffer to benefit him or any 
one else, by my good will; when, hearing a rustle among the ling,
I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff almost close upon us, 
descending the Heights.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t cast a glance 
towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for 
Linton&rsquo;s sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost 
hearty tone he assumed to none besides, and the sincerity of 
which I couldn&rsquo;t avoid doubting, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is something to see you so near to my house, 
Nelly.&nbsp; How are you at the Grange?&nbsp; Let us hear.&nbsp; 
The rumour goes,&rsquo; he added, in a lower tone, &lsquo;that 
Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his 
illness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; my master is dying,&rsquo; I replied: &lsquo;it is 
true enough.&nbsp; A sad thing it will be for us all, but a 
blessing for him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long will he last, do you think?&rsquo; he 
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; he continued, looking at the two young 
people, who were fixed under his eye&mdash;Linton appeared as if 
he could not venture to stir or raise his head, and Catherine 
could not move, on his account&mdash;&lsquo;because that lad 
yonder seems determined to beat me; and I&rsquo;d thank his uncle
to be quick, and go before him!&nbsp; Hallo! has the whelp been 
playing that game long?&nbsp; I <i>did</i> give him some lessons 
about snivelling.&nbsp; Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton 
generally?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lively? no&mdash;he has shown the greatest 
distress,&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;To see him, I should 
say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills, 
he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He shall be, in a day or two,&rsquo; muttered 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; &lsquo;But first&mdash;get up, Linton!&nbsp; 
Get up!&rsquo; he shouted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t grovel on the
ground there up, this moment!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of 
helpless fear, caused by his father&rsquo;s glance towards him, I
suppose: there was nothing else to produce such 
humiliation.&nbsp; He made several efforts to obey, but his 
little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back 
again with a moan.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him 
to lean against a ridge of turf.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said he, with curbed ferocity, 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m getting angry and if you don&rsquo;t command 
that paltry spirit of yours&mdash;<i>damn</i> you! get up 
directly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, father,&rsquo; he panted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only, 
let me alone, or I shall faint.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done as you 
wished, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; Catherine will tell you that 
I&mdash;that I&mdash;have been cheerful.&nbsp; Ah! keep by me, 
Catherine; give me your hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take mine,&rsquo; said his father; &lsquo;stand on your
feet.&nbsp; There now&mdash;she&rsquo;ll lend you her arm: 
that&rsquo;s right, look at her.&nbsp; You would imagine I was 
the devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror.&nbsp; Be 
so kind as to walk home with him, will you?&nbsp; He shudders if 
I touch him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Linton dear!&rsquo; whispered Catherine, &lsquo;I 
can&rsquo;t go to Wuthering Heights: papa has forbidden me.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll not harm you: why are you so afraid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can never re-enter that house,&rsquo; he 
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> to re-enter it 
without you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; cried his father.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
respect Catherine&rsquo;s filial scruples.&nbsp; Nelly, take him 
in, and I&rsquo;ll follow your advice concerning the doctor, 
without delay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll do well,&rsquo; replied I.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But I must remain with my mistress: to mind your son is 
not my business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very stiff,&rsquo; said Heathcliff, &lsquo;I 
know that: but you&rsquo;ll force me to pinch the baby and make 
it scream before it moves your charity.&nbsp; Come, then, my 
hero.&nbsp; Are you willing to return, escorted by me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the 
fragile being; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, 
and implored her to accompany him, with a frantic importunity 
that admitted no denial.&nbsp; However I disapproved, I 
couldn&rsquo;t hinder her: indeed, how could she have refused him
herself?&nbsp; What was filling him with dread we had no means of
discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and any 
addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiotcy.&nbsp; We 
reached the threshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting 
till she had conducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out 
immediately; when Mr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, 
exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;My house is not stricken with the plague, 
Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit down, and 
allow me to shut the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He shut and locked it also.&nbsp; I started.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall have tea before you go home,&rsquo; he 
added.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am by myself.&nbsp; Hareton is gone with 
some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are off on a 
journey of pleasure; and, though I&rsquo;m used to being alone, 
I&rsquo;d rather have some interesting company, if I can get 
it.&nbsp; Miss Linton, take your seat by <i>him</i>.&nbsp; I give
you what I have: the present is hardly worth accepting; but I 
have nothing else to offer.&nbsp; It is Linton, I mean.&nbsp; How
she does stare!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s odd what a savage feeling I have
to anything that seems afraid of me!&nbsp; Had I been born where 
laws are less strict and tastes less dainty, I should treat 
myself to a slow vivisection of those two, as an evening&rsquo;s 
amusement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself,
&lsquo;By hell!&nbsp; I hate them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not afraid of you!&rsquo; exclaimed Catherine, who
could not hear the latter part of his speech.&nbsp; She stepped 
close up; her black eyes flashing with passion and 
resolution.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give me that key: I will have it!&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t eat or drink here, if I 
were starving.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the 
table.&nbsp; He looked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her 
boldness; or, possibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the
person from whom she inherited it.&nbsp; She snatched at the 
instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened 
fingers: but her action recalled him to the present; he recovered
it speedily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Catherine Linton,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;stand 
off, or I shall knock you down; and, that will make Mrs. Dean 
mad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and 
its contents again.&nbsp; &lsquo;We will go!&rsquo; she repeated,
exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; 
and finding that her nails made no impression, she applied her 
teeth pretty sharply.&nbsp; Heathcliff glanced at me a glance 
that kept me from interfering a moment.&nbsp; Catherine was too 
intent on his fingers to notice his face.&nbsp; He opened them 
suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had 
well secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, 
pulling her on his knee, administered with the other a shower of 
terrific slaps on both sides of the head, each sufficient to have
fulfilled his threat, had she been able to fall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You villain!&rsquo; I began to cry, &lsquo;you 
villain!&rsquo;&nbsp; A touch on the chest silenced me: I am 
stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the 
rage, I staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate, or to
burst a blood-vessel.&nbsp; The scene was over in two minutes; 
Catherine, released, put her two hands to her temples, and looked
just as if she were not sure whether her ears were off or 
on.&nbsp; She trembled like a reed, poor thing, and leant against
the table perfectly bewildered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know how to chastise children, you see,&rsquo; said 
the scoundrel, grimly, as he stooped to repossess himself of the 
key, which had dropped to the floor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go to Linton 
now, as I told you; and cry at your ease!&nbsp; I shall be your 
father, to-morrow&mdash;all the father you&rsquo;ll have in a few
days&mdash;and you shall have plenty of that.&nbsp; You can bear 
plenty; you&rsquo;re no weakling: you shall have a daily taste, 
if I catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes 
again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her 
burning cheek on my lap, weeping aloud.&nbsp; Her cousin had 
shrunk into a corner of the settle, as quiet as a mouse, 
congratulating himself, I dare say, that the correction had 
alighted on another than him.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff, perceiving us
all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea 
himself.&nbsp; The cups and saucers were laid ready.&nbsp; He 
poured it out, and handed me a cup.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wash away your spleen,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
help your own naughty pet and mine.&nbsp; It is not poisoned, 
though I prepared it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going out to seek your 
horses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit 
somewhere.&nbsp; We tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened
outside: we looked at the windows&mdash;they were too narrow for 
even Cathy&rsquo;s little figure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Master Linton,&rsquo; I cried, seeing we were regularly
imprisoned, &lsquo;you know what your diabolical father is after,
and you shall tell us, or I&rsquo;ll box your ears, as he has 
done your cousin&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Linton, you must tell,&rsquo; said 
Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was for your sake I came; and it will 
be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me some tea, I&rsquo;m thirsty, and then 
I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs. Dean, 
go away.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like you standing over me.&nbsp; 
Now, Catherine, you are letting your tears fall into my 
cup.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t drink that.&nbsp; Give me 
another.&rsquo;&nbsp; Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped 
her face.&nbsp; I felt disgusted at the little wretch&rsquo;s 
composure, since he was no longer in terror for himself.&nbsp; 
The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever
he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been menaced 
with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us 
there; and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate 
fears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa wants us to be married,&rsquo; he continued, after
sipping some of the liquid.&nbsp; &lsquo;And he knows your papa 
wouldn&rsquo;t let us marry now; and he&rsquo;s afraid of my 
dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning, and you
are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you 
shall return home next day, and take me with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take you with her, pitiful changeling!&rsquo; I 
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>You</i> marry?&nbsp; Why, the man is 
mad! or he thinks us fools, every one.&nbsp; And do you imagine 
that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie 
herself to a little perishing monkey like you?&nbsp; Are you 
cherishing the notion that anybody, let alone Miss Catherine 
Linton, would have you for a husband?&nbsp; You want whipping for
bringing us in here at all, with your dastardly puling tricks: 
and&mdash;don&rsquo;t look so silly, now!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a very
good mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery,
and your imbecile conceit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, 
and he took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and 
Catherine rebuked me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay all night?&nbsp; No,&rsquo; she said, looking 
slowly round.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ellen, I&rsquo;ll burn that door down 
but I&rsquo;ll get out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she would have commenced the execution of her threat 
directly, but Linton was up in alarm for his dear self 
again.&nbsp; He clasped her in his two feeble arms 
sobbing:&mdash;&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you have me, and save me? not 
let me come to the Grange?&nbsp; Oh, darling Catherine! you 
mustn&rsquo;t go and leave, after all.&nbsp; You <i>must</i> obey
my father&mdash;you <i>must</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must obey my own,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;and 
relieve him from this cruel suspense.&nbsp; The whole 
night!&nbsp; What would he think?&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be distressed
already.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll either break or burn a way out of the 
house.&nbsp; Be quiet!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re in no danger; but if 
you hinder me&mdash;Linton, I love papa better than 
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; The mortal terror he felt of Mr. 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s anger restored to the boy his coward&rsquo;s 
eloquence.&nbsp; Catherine was near distraught: still, she 
persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn, 
persuading him to subdue his selfish agony.&nbsp; While they were
thus occupied, our jailor re-entered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your beasts have trotted off,&rsquo; he said, 
&lsquo;and&mdash;now Linton! snivelling again?&nbsp; What has she
been doing to you?&nbsp; Come, come&mdash;have done, and get to 
bed.&nbsp; In a month or two, my lad, you&rsquo;ll be able to pay
her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand.&nbsp; 
You&rsquo;re pining for pure love, are you not? nothing else in 
the world: and she shall have you!&nbsp; There, to bed!&nbsp; 
Zillah won&rsquo;t be here to-night; you must undress 
yourself.&nbsp; Hush! hold your noise!&nbsp; Once in your own 
room, I&rsquo;ll not come near you: you needn&rsquo;t fear.&nbsp;
By chance, you&rsquo;ve managed tolerably.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll look 
to the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to 
pass, and the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might
which suspected the person who attended on it of designing a 
spiteful squeeze.&nbsp; The lock was re-secured.&nbsp; Heathcliff
approached the fire, where my mistress and I stood silent.&nbsp; 
Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to her 
cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation.&nbsp; 
Anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish 
act with sternness, but he scowled on her and 
muttered&mdash;&lsquo;Oh! you are not afraid of me?&nbsp; Your 
courage is well disguised: you seem damnably afraid!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>am</i> afraid now,&rsquo; she replied, 
&lsquo;because, if I stay, papa will be miserable: and how can I 
endure making him miserable&mdash;when he&mdash;when he&mdash;Mr.
Heathcliff, let <i>me</i> go home!&nbsp; I promise to marry 
Linton: papa would like me to: and I love him.&nbsp; Why should 
you wish to force me to do what I&rsquo;ll willingly do of 
myself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let him dare to force you,&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s law in the land, thank God! there is; though
we be in an out-of-the-way place.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d inform if he 
were my own son: and it&rsquo;s felony without benefit of 
clergy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; said the ruffian.&nbsp; &lsquo;To the 
devil with your clamour!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want <i>you</i> to 
speak.&nbsp; Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in 
thinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for 
satisfaction.&nbsp; You could have hit on no surer way of fixing 
your residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than 
informing me that such an event would follow.&nbsp; As to your 
promise to marry Linton, I&rsquo;ll take care you shall keep it; 
for you shall not quit this place till it is 
fulfilled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I&rsquo;m 
safe!&rsquo; exclaimed Catherine, weeping bitterly.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Or marry me now.&nbsp; Poor papa!&nbsp; Ellen, he&rsquo;ll
think we&rsquo;re lost.&nbsp; What shall we do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not he!&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll think you are tired of 
waiting on him, and run off for a little amusement,&rsquo; 
answered Heathcliff.&nbsp; &lsquo;You cannot deny that you 
entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his 
injunctions to the contrary.&nbsp; And it is quite natural that 
you should desire amusement at your age; and that you would weary
of nursing a sick man, and that man <i>only</i> your 
father.&nbsp; Catherine, his happiest days were over when your 
days began.&nbsp; He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the 
world (I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as
<i>he</i> went out of it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d join him.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t love you!&nbsp; How should I?&nbsp; Weep away.&nbsp; 
As far as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; 
unless Linton make amends for other losses: and your provident 
parent appears to fancy he may.&nbsp; His letters of advice and 
consolation entertained me vastly.&nbsp; In his last he 
recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and kind to her when 
he got her.&nbsp; Careful and kind&mdash;that&rsquo;s 
paternal.&nbsp; But Linton requires his whole stock of care and 
kindness for himself.&nbsp; Linton can play the little tyrant 
well.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll undertake to torture any number of cats, 
if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his <i>kindness</i>, when
you get home again, I assure you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re right there!&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;explain
your son&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; Show his resemblance to 
yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice before 
she takes the cockatrice!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t much mind speaking of his amiable 
qualities now,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;because she must either
accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along with her, till 
your master dies.&nbsp; I can detain you both, quite concealed, 
here.&nbsp; If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and 
you&rsquo;ll have an opportunity of judging!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not retract my word,&rsquo; said 
Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll marry him within this hour, if
I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff, 
you&rsquo;re a cruel man, but you&rsquo;re not a fiend; and you 
won&rsquo;t, from <i>mere</i> malice, destroy irrevocably all my 
happiness.&nbsp; If papa thought I had left him on purpose, and 
if he died before I returned, could I bear to live?&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ve given over crying: but I&rsquo;m going to kneel here, 
at your knee; and I&rsquo;ll not get up, and I&rsquo;ll not take 
my eyes from your face till you look back at me!&nbsp; No, 
don&rsquo;t turn away! <i>do look</i>! you&rsquo;ll see nothing 
to provoke you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t hate you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
angry that you struck me.&nbsp; Have you never loved 
<i>anybody</i> in all your life, uncle? <i>never</i>?&nbsp; Ah! 
you must look once.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so wretched, you can&rsquo;t 
help being sorry and pitying me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keep your eft&rsquo;s fingers off; and move, or 
I&rsquo;ll kick you!&rsquo; cried Heathcliff, brutally repulsing 
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather be hugged by a snake.&nbsp; 
How the devil can you dream of fawning on me?&nbsp; I 
<i>detest</i> you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his 
flesh crept with aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got
up, and opened my mouth, to commence a downright torrent of 
abuse.&nbsp; But I was rendered dumb in the middle of the first 
sentence, by a threat that I should be shown into a room by 
myself the very next syllable I uttered.&nbsp; It was growing 
dark&mdash;we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate.&nbsp; 
Our host hurried out instantly: <i>he</i> had his wits about him;
<i>we</i> had not.&nbsp; There was a talk of two or three 
minutes, and he returned alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,&rsquo; I 
observed to Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish he would arrive!&nbsp;
Who knows but he might take our part?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was three servants sent to seek you from the 
Grange,&rsquo; said Heathcliff, overhearing me.&nbsp; &lsquo;You 
should have opened a lattice and called out: but I could swear 
that chit is glad you didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s glad to be 
obliged to stay, I&rsquo;m certain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our
grief without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine 
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Then he bid us go upstairs, through the 
kitchen, to Zillah&rsquo;s chamber; and I whispered my companion 
to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get through the window 
there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.&nbsp; The 
window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret 
trap was safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as 
before.&nbsp; We neither of us lay down: Catherine took her 
station by the lattice, and watched anxiously for morning; a deep
sigh being the only answer I could obtain to my frequent 
entreaties that she would try to rest.&nbsp; I seated myself in a
chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment on my many 
derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the 
misfortunes of my employers sprang.&nbsp; It was not the case, in
reality, I am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal 
night; and I thought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.</p>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton 
had risen.&nbsp; She ran to the door immediately, and answered, 
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Here, then,&rsquo; he said, 
opening it, and pulling her out.&nbsp; I rose to follow, but he 
turned the lock again.&nbsp; I demanded my release.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be patient,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send 
up your breakfast in a while.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily and 
Catherine asked why I was still shut up?&nbsp; He answered, I 
must try to endure it another hour, and they went away.&nbsp; I 
endured it two or three hours; at length, I heard a footstep: not
Heathcliff&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you something to eat,&rsquo; said a 
voice; &lsquo;oppen t&rsquo; door!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to
last me all day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tak&rsquo; it,&rsquo; he added, thrusting the tray into
my hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay one minute,&rsquo; I began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; cried he, and retired, regardless of any 
prayers I could pour forth to detain him.</p>
<p>And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of 
the next night; and another, and another.&nbsp; Five nights and 
four days I remained, altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once 
every morning; and he was a model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, 
and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or 
compassion.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<p>On the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step 
approached&mdash;lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person 
entered the room.&nbsp; It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet 
shawl, with a black silk bonnet on her head, and a willow-basket 
swung to her arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh, dear!&nbsp; Mrs. Dean!&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Well! there is a talk about you at Gimmerton.&nbsp; I 
never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse marsh, and 
missy with you, till master told me you&rsquo;d been found, and 
he&rsquo;d lodged you here!&nbsp; What! and you must have got on 
an island, sure?&nbsp; And how long were you in the hole?&nbsp; 
Did master save you, Mrs. Dean?&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re not so 
thin&mdash;you&rsquo;ve not been so poorly, have you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your master is a true scoundrel!&rsquo; I 
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;But he shall answer for it.&nbsp; He 
needn&rsquo;t have raised that tale: it shall all be laid 
bare!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; asked Zillah.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not his tale: they tell that in the 
village&mdash;about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to 
Earnshaw, when I come in&mdash;&ldquo;Eh, they&rsquo;s queer 
things, Mr. Hareton, happened since I went off.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 
a sad pity of that likely young lass, and cant Nelly 
Dean.&rdquo;&nbsp; He stared.&nbsp; I thought he had not heard 
aught, so I told him the rumour.&nbsp; The master listened, and 
he just smiled to himself, and said, &ldquo;If they have been in 
the marsh, they are out now, Zillah.&nbsp; Nelly Dean is lodged, 
at this minute, in your room.&nbsp; You can tell her to flit, 
when you go up; here is the key.&nbsp; The bog-water got into her
head, and she would have run home quite flighty; but I fixed her 
till she came round to her senses.&nbsp; You can bid her go to 
the Grange at once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, 
that her young lady will follow in time to attend the 
squire&rsquo;s funeral.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Edgar is not dead?&rsquo; I gasped.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Oh! Zillah, Zillah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,&rsquo; she 
replied; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re right sickly yet.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s 
not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another day.&nbsp; I 
met him on the road and asked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and 
hastened below, for the way was free.&nbsp; On entering the 
house, I looked about for some one to give information of 
Catherine.&nbsp; The place was filled with sunshine, and the door
stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand.&nbsp; As I hesitated 
whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a 
slight cough drew my attention to the hearth.&nbsp; Linton lay on
the settle, sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and 
pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is 
Miss Catherine?&rsquo; I demanded sternly, supposing I could 
frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching him thus, 
alone.&nbsp; He sucked on like an innocent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she gone?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;she&rsquo;s upstairs: 
she&rsquo;s not to go; we won&rsquo;t let her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t let her, little idiot!&rsquo; I 
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Direct me to her room immediately, or 
I&rsquo;ll make you sing out sharply.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get 
there,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;He says I&rsquo;m not to 
be soft with Catherine: she&rsquo;s my wife, and it&rsquo;s 
shameful that she should wish to leave me.&nbsp; He says she 
hates me and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she
shan&rsquo;t have it: and she shan&rsquo;t go home!&nbsp; She 
never shall!&mdash;she may cry, and be sick as much as she 
pleases!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he 
meant to drop asleep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Master Heathcliff,&rsquo; I resumed, &lsquo;have you 
forgotten all Catherine&rsquo;s kindness to you last winter, when
you affirmed you loved her, and when she brought you books and 
sung you songs, and came many a time through wind and snow to see
you?&nbsp; She wept to miss one evening, because you would be 
disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times too 
good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, 
though you know he detests you both.&nbsp; And you join him 
against her.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s fine gratitude, is it 
not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The corner of Linton&rsquo;s mouth fell, and he took the 
sugar-candy from his lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated 
you?&rsquo; I continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;Think for yourself!&nbsp; 
As to your money, she does not even know that you will have 
any.&nbsp; And you say she&rsquo;s sick; and yet you leave her 
alone, up there in a strange house!&nbsp; You who have felt what 
it is to be so neglected!&nbsp; You could pity your own 
sufferings; and she pitied them, too; but you won&rsquo;t pity 
hers!&nbsp; I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you see&mdash;an 
elderly woman, and a servant merely&mdash;and you, after 
pretending such affection, and having reason to worship her 
almost, store every tear you have for yourself, and lie there 
quite at ease.&nbsp; Ah! you&rsquo;re a heartless, selfish 
boy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stay with her,&rsquo; he answered 
crossly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not stay by myself.&nbsp; She 
cries so I can&rsquo;t bear it.&nbsp; And she won&rsquo;t give 
over, though I say I&rsquo;ll call my father.&nbsp; I did call 
him once, and he threatened to strangle her if she was not quiet;
but she began again the instant he left the room, moaning and 
grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that I 
couldn&rsquo;t sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Mr. Heathcliff out?&rsquo; I inquired, perceiving 
that the wretched creature had no power to sympathize with his 
cousin&rsquo;s mental tortures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s in the court,&rsquo; he replied, 
&lsquo;talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says uncle is dying, truly,
at last.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad, for I shall be master of the 
Grange after him.&nbsp; Catherine always spoke of it as her 
house.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t hers!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s mine: papa 
says everything she has is mine.&nbsp; All her nice books are 
mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and her 
pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out; 
but I told her she had nothing to give, they ware all, all 
mine.&nbsp; And then she cried, and took a little picture from 
her neck, and said I should have that; two pictures in a gold 
case, on one side her mother, and on the other uncle, when they 
were young.&nbsp; That was yesterday&mdash;I said they were mine,
too; and tried to get them from her.&nbsp; The spiteful thing 
wouldn&rsquo;t let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me.&nbsp; I 
shrieked out&mdash;that frightens her&mdash;she heard papa 
coming, and she broke the hinges and divided the case, and gave 
me her mother&rsquo;s portrait; the other she attempted to hide: 
but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained it.&nbsp; He 
took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me; 
she refused, and he&mdash;he struck her down, and wrenched it off
the chain, and crushed it with his foot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And were you pleased to see her struck?&rsquo; I asked:
having my designs in encouraging his talk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I winked,&rsquo; he answered: &lsquo;I wink to see my 
father strike a dog or a horse, he does it so hard.&nbsp; Yet I 
was glad at first&mdash;she deserved punishing for pushing me: 
but when papa was gone, she made me come to the window and showed
me her cheek cut on the inside, against her teeth, and her mouth 
filling with blood; and then she gathered up the bits of the 
picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall, and she
has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she 
can&rsquo;t speak for pain.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like to think so;
but she&rsquo;s a naughty thing for crying continually; and she 
looks so pale and wild, I&rsquo;m afraid of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you can get the key if you choose?&rsquo; I 
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, when I am up-stairs,&rsquo; he answered; 
&lsquo;but I can&rsquo;t walk up-stairs now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In what apartment is it?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t tell 
<i>you</i> where it is.&nbsp; It is our secret.&nbsp; Nobody, 
neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know.&nbsp; There! you&rsquo;ve
tired me&mdash;go away, go away!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he turned his 
face on to his arm, and shut his eyes again.</p>
<p>I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, 
and bring a rescue for my young lady from the Grange.&nbsp; On 
reaching it, the astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, 
and their joy also, was intense; and when they heard that their 
little mistress was safe, two or three were about to hurry up and
shout the news at Mr. Edgar&rsquo;s door: but I bespoke the 
announcement of it myself.&nbsp; How changed I found him, even in
those few days!&nbsp; He lay an image of sadness and resignation 
awaiting his death.&nbsp; Very young he looked: though his actual
age was thirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger,
at least.&nbsp; He thought of Catherine; for he murmured her 
name.&nbsp; I touched his hand, and spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Catherine is coming, dear master!&rsquo; I whispered; 
&lsquo;she is alive and well; and will be here, I hope, 
to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half 
rose up, looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back 
in a swoon.&nbsp; As soon as he recovered, I related our 
compulsory visit, and detention at the Heights.&nbsp; I said 
Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite true.&nbsp; I 
uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I describe 
all his father&rsquo;s brutal conduct&mdash;my intentions being 
to add no bitterness, if I could help it, to his already 
over-flowing cup.</p>
<p>He divined that one of his enemy&rsquo;s purposes was to 
secure the personal property, as well as the estate, to his son: 
or rather himself; yet why he did not wait till his decease was a
puzzle to my master, because ignorant how nearly he and his 
nephew would quit the world together.&nbsp; However, he felt that
his will had better be altered: instead of leaving 
Catherine&rsquo;s fortune at her own disposal, he determined to 
put it in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for 
her children, if she had any, after her.&nbsp; By that means, it 
could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die.</p>
<p>Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the 
attorney, and four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to 
demand my young lady of her jailor.&nbsp; Both parties were 
delayed very late.&nbsp; The single servant returned first.&nbsp;
He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he arrived at his 
house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance; and then
Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village that 
must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before 
morning.&nbsp; The four men came back unaccompanied also.&nbsp; 
They brought word that Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her 
room; and Heathcliff would not suffer them to see her.&nbsp; I 
scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale, which
I would not carry to my master; resolving to take a whole bevy up
to the Heights, at day-light, and storm it literally, unless the 
prisoner were quietly surrendered to us.&nbsp; Her father 
<i>shall</i> see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be 
killed on his own doorstones in trying to prevent it!</p>
<p>Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble.&nbsp; I had
gone down-stairs at three o&rsquo;clock to fetch a jug of water; 
and was passing through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp
knock at the front door made me jump.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! it is 
Green,&rsquo; I said, recollecting myself&mdash;&lsquo;only 
Green,&rsquo; and I went on, intending to send somebody else to 
open it; but the knock was repeated: not loud, and still 
importunately.&nbsp; I put the jug on the banister and hastened 
to admit him myself.&nbsp; The harvest moon shone clear 
outside.&nbsp; It was not the attorney.&nbsp; My own sweet little
mistress sprang on my neck sobbing, &lsquo;Ellen, Ellen!&nbsp; Is
papa alive?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I cried: &lsquo;yes, my angel, he is, God 
be thanked, you are safe with us again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She wanted to run, breathless as she was, up-stairs to Mr. 
Linton&rsquo;s room; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, 
and made her drink, and washed her pale face, chafing it into a 
faint colour with my apron.&nbsp; Then I said I must go first, 
and tell of her arrival; imploring her to say, she should be 
happy with young Heathcliff.&nbsp; She stared, but soon 
comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she 
assured me she would not complain.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t abide to be present at their meeting.&nbsp; I
stood outside the chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly 
ventured near the bed, then.&nbsp; All was composed, however: 
Catherine&rsquo;s despair was as silent as her father&rsquo;s 
joy.&nbsp; She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed 
on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with 
ecstasy.</p>
<p>He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so.&nbsp; Kissing 
her cheek, he murmured,&mdash;&lsquo;I am going to her; and you, 
darling child, shall come to us!&rsquo; and never stirred or 
spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant gaze, till his 
pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed.&nbsp; None 
could have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so 
entirely without a struggle.</p>
<p>Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief 
were too weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till 
the sun rose: she sat till noon, and would still have remained 
brooding over that deathbed, but I insisted on her coming away 
and taking some repose.&nbsp; It was well I succeeded in removing
her, for at dinner-time appeared the lawyer, having called at 
Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how to behave.&nbsp; He
had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of his 
delay in obeying my master&rsquo;s summons.&nbsp; Fortunately, no
thought of worldly affairs crossed the latter&rsquo;s mind, to 
disturb him, after his daughter&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody 
about the place.&nbsp; He gave all the servants but me, notice to
quit.&nbsp; He would have carried his delegated authority to the 
point of insisting that Edgar Linton should not be buried beside 
his wife, but in the chapel, with his family.&nbsp; There was the
will, however, to hinder that, and my loud protestations against 
any infringement of its directions.&nbsp; The funeral was hurried
over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered to stay
at the Grange till her father&rsquo;s corpse had quitted it.</p>
<p>She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to 
incur the risk of liberating her.&nbsp; She heard the men I sent 
disputing at the door, and she gathered the sense of 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s answer.&nbsp; It drove her desperate.&nbsp; 
Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after 
I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father 
re-ascended.&nbsp; He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the 
door, without shutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, 
he begged to sleep with Hareton, and his petition was granted for
once.&nbsp; Catherine stole out before break of day.&nbsp; She 
dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm; she 
visited the empty chambers and examined their windows; and, 
luckily, lighting on her mother&rsquo;s, she got easily out of 
its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir-tree close
by.&nbsp; Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape, 
notwithstanding his timid contrivances.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<p>The evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated
in the library; now musing mournfully&mdash;one of us 
despairingly&mdash;on our loss, now venturing conjectures as to 
the gloomy future.</p>
<p>We had just agreed the best destiny which could await 
Catherine would be a permission to continue resident at the 
Grange; at least during Linton&rsquo;s life: he being allowed to 
join her there, and I to remain as housekeeper.&nbsp; That seemed
rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for; and yet I 
did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining 
my home and my employment, and, above all, my beloved young 
mistress; when a servant&mdash;one of the discarded ones, not yet
departed&mdash;rushed hastily in, and said &lsquo;that devil 
Heathcliff&rsquo; was coming through the court: should he fasten 
the door in his face?</p>
<p>If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not
time.&nbsp; He made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his 
name: he was master, and availed himself of the master&rsquo;s 
privilege to walk straight in, without saying a word.&nbsp; The 
sound of our informant&rsquo;s voice directed him to the library;
he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.</p>
<p>It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a 
guest, eighteen years before: the same moon shone through the 
window; and the same autumn landscape lay outside.&nbsp; We had 
not yet lighted a candle, but all the apartment was visible, even
to the portraits on the wall: the splendid head of Mrs. Linton, 
and the graceful one of her husband.&nbsp; Heathcliff advanced to
the hearth.&nbsp; Time had little altered his person 
either.&nbsp; There was the same man: his dark face rather 
sallower and more composed, his frame a stone or two heavier, 
perhaps, and no other difference.&nbsp; Catherine had risen with 
an impulse to dash out, when she saw him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; he said, arresting her by the arm.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;No more runnings away!&nbsp; Where would you go?&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m come to fetch you home; and I hope you&rsquo;ll be a 
dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further 
disobedience.&nbsp; I was embarrassed how to punish him when I 
discovered his part in the business: he&rsquo;s such a cobweb, a 
pinch would annihilate him; but you&rsquo;ll see by his look that
he has received his due!&nbsp; I brought him down one evening, 
the day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and never 
touched him afterwards.&nbsp; I sent Hareton out, and we had the 
room to ourselves.&nbsp; In two hours, I called Joseph to carry 
him up again; and since then my presence is as potent on his 
nerves as a ghost; and I fancy he sees me often, though I am not 
near.&nbsp; Hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the night by the
hour together, and calls you to protect him from me; and, whether
you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he&rsquo;s 
your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to 
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not let Catherine continue here,&rsquo; I pleaded, 
&lsquo;and send Master Linton to her?&nbsp; As you hate them 
both, you&rsquo;d not miss them: they can only be a daily plague 
to your unnatural heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m seeking a tenant for the Grange,&rsquo; he 
answered; &lsquo;and I want my children about me, to be 
sure.&nbsp; Besides, that lass owes me her services for her 
bread.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to nurture her in luxury and 
idleness after Linton is gone.&nbsp; Make haste and get ready, 
now; and don&rsquo;t oblige me to compel you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall,&rsquo; said Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Linton is 
all I have to love in the world, and though you have done what 
you could to make him hateful to me, and me to him, you cannot 
make us hate each other.&nbsp; And I defy you to hurt him when I 
am by, and I defy you to frighten me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a boastful champion,&rsquo; replied Heathcliff;
&lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t like you well enough to hurt him: you 
shall get the full benefit of the torment, as long as it 
lasts.&nbsp; It is not I who will make him hateful to 
you&mdash;it is his own sweet spirit.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s as bitter 
as gall at your desertion and its consequences: don&rsquo;t 
expect thanks for this noble devotion.&nbsp; I heard him draw a 
pleasant picture to Zillah of what he would do if he were as 
strong as I: the inclination is there, and his very weakness will
sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know he has a bad nature,&rsquo; said Catherine: 
&lsquo;he&rsquo;s your son.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve a
better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that 
reason I love him.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff <i>you</i> have 
<i>nobody</i> to love you; and, however miserable you make us, we
shall still have the revenge of thinking that your cruelty arises
from your greater misery.&nbsp; You <i>are</i> miserable, are you
not?&nbsp; Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?&nbsp; 
<i>Nobody</i> loves you&mdash;<i>nobody</i> will cry for you when
you die!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t be you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to 
have made up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future 
family, and draw pleasure from the griefs of her enemies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,&rsquo; 
said her father-in-law, &lsquo;if you stand there another 
minute.&nbsp; Begone, witch, and get your things!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She scornfully withdrew.&nbsp; In her absence I began to beg 
for Zillah&rsquo;s place at the Heights, offering to resign mine 
to her; but he would suffer it on no account.&nbsp; He bid me be 
silent; and then, for the first time, allowed himself a glance 
round the room and a look at the pictures.&nbsp; Having studied 
Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s, he said&mdash;&lsquo;I shall have that 
home.&nbsp; Not because I need it, but&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He 
turned abruptly to the fire, and continued, with what, for lack 
of a better word, I must call a smile&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll 
tell you what I did yesterday!&nbsp; I got the sexton, who was 
digging Linton&rsquo;s grave, to remove the earth off her coffin 
lid, and I opened it.&nbsp; I thought, once, I would have stayed 
there: when I saw her face again&mdash;it is hers yet!&mdash;he 
had hard work to stir me; but he said it would change if the air 
blew on it, and so I struck one side of the coffin loose, and 
covered it up: not Linton&rsquo;s side, damn him!&nbsp; I wish 
he&rsquo;d been soldered in lead.&nbsp; And I bribed the sexton 
to pull it away when I&rsquo;m laid there, and slide mine out 
too; I&rsquo;ll have it made so: and then by the time Linton gets
to us he&rsquo;ll not know which is which!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!&rsquo; I 
exclaimed; &lsquo;were you not ashamed to disturb the 
dead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I disturbed nobody, Nelly,&rsquo; he replied; 
&lsquo;and I gave some ease to myself.&nbsp; I shall be a great 
deal more comfortable now; and you&rsquo;ll have a better chance 
of keeping me underground, when I get there.&nbsp; Disturbed 
her?&nbsp; No! she has disturbed me, night and day, through 
eighteen years&mdash;incessantly&mdash;remorselessly&mdash;till 
yesternight; and yesternight I was tranquil.&nbsp; I dreamt I was
sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with my heart stopped 
and my cheek frozen against hers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, 
what would you have dreamt of then?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of dissolving with her, and being more happy 
still!&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you suppose I dread 
any change of that sort?&nbsp; I expected such a transformation 
on raising the lid&mdash;but I&rsquo;m better pleased that it 
should not commence till I share it.&nbsp; Besides, unless I had 
received a distinct impression of her passionless features, that 
strange feeling would hardly have been removed.&nbsp; It began 
oddly.&nbsp; You know I was wild after she died; and eternally, 
from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her spirit!&nbsp; 
I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they 
can, and do, exist among us!&nbsp; The day she was buried, there 
came a fall of snow.&nbsp; In the evening I went to the 
churchyard.&nbsp; It blew bleak as winter&mdash;all round was 
solitary.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t fear that her fool of a husband 
would wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to
bring them there.&nbsp; Being alone, and conscious two yards of 
loose earth was the sole barrier between us, I said to 
myself&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have her in my arms again!&nbsp; 
If she be cold, I&rsquo;ll think it is this north wind that 
chills <i>me</i>; and if she be motionless, it is 
sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; I got a spade from the tool-house, and began 
to delve with all my might&mdash;it scraped the coffin; I fell to
work with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the screws;
I was on the point of attaining my object, when it seemed that I 
heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the grave,
and bending down.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I can only get this off,&rdquo;
I muttered, &ldquo;I wish they may shovel in the earth over us 
both!&rdquo; and I wrenched at it more desperately still.&nbsp; 
There was another sigh, close at my ear.&nbsp; I appeared to feel
the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind.&nbsp; I 
knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as certainly
as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in the 
dark, though it cannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that 
Cathy was there: not under me, but on the earth.&nbsp; A sudden 
sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb.&nbsp; I 
relinquished my labour of agony, and turned consoled at once: 
unspeakably consoled.&nbsp; Her presence was with me: it remained
while I re-filled the grave, and led me home.&nbsp; You may 
laugh, if you will; but I was sure I should see her there.&nbsp; 
I was sure she was with me, and I could not help talking to 
her.&nbsp; Having reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the 
door.&nbsp; It was fastened; and, I remember, that accursed 
Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance.&nbsp; I remember 
stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying 
up-stairs, to my room and hers.&nbsp; I looked round 
impatiently&mdash;I felt her by me&mdash;I could <i>almost</i> 
see her, and yet I <i>could not</i>!&nbsp; I ought to have sweat 
blood then, from the anguish of my yearning&mdash;from the 
fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse!&nbsp; I had 
not one.&nbsp; She showed herself, as she often was in life, a 
devil to me!&nbsp; And, since then, sometimes more and sometimes 
less, I&rsquo;ve been the sport of that intolerable 
torture!&nbsp; Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch 
that, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have 
relaxed to the feebleness of Linton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; When I sat in 
the house with Hareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet
her; when I walked on the moors I should meet her coming 
in.&nbsp; When I went from home I hastened to return; she 
<i>must</i> be somewhere at the Heights, I was certain!&nbsp; And
when I slept in her chamber&mdash;I was beaten out of that.&nbsp;
I couldn&rsquo;t lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she 
was either outside the window, or sliding back the panels, or 
entering the room, or even resting her darling head on the same 
pillow as she did when a child; and I must open my lids to 
see.&nbsp; And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a 
night&mdash;to be always disappointed!&nbsp; It racked me!&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ve often groaned aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no 
doubt believed that my conscience was playing the fiend inside of
me.&nbsp; Now, since I&rsquo;ve seen her, I&rsquo;m 
pacified&mdash;a little.&nbsp; It was a strange way of killing: 
not by inches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me 
with the spectre of a hope through eighteen years!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung 
to it, wet with perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red 
embers of the fire, the brows not contracted, but raised next the
temples; diminishing the grim aspect of his countenance, but 
imparting a peculiar look of trouble, and a painful appearance of
mental tension towards one absorbing subject.&nbsp; He only half 
addressed me, and I maintained silence.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like
to hear him talk!&nbsp; After a short period he resumed his 
meditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the 
sofa to contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied
Catherine entered, announcing that she was ready, when her pony 
should be saddled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Send that over to-morrow,&rsquo; said Heathcliff to me;
then turning to her, he added: &lsquo;You may do without your 
pony: it is a fine evening, and you&rsquo;ll need no ponies at 
Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take, your own feet will
serve you.&nbsp; Come along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Ellen!&rsquo; whispered my dear little 
mistress.</p>
<p>As she kissed me, her lips felt like ice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come 
and see me, Ellen; don&rsquo;t forget.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!&rsquo; said 
her new father.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I wish to speak to you 
I&rsquo;ll come here.&nbsp; I want none of your prying at my 
house!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut
my heart, she obeyed.&nbsp; I watched them, from the window, walk
down the garden.&nbsp; Heathcliff fixed Catherine&rsquo;s arm 
under his: though she disputed the act at first evidently; and 
with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley, whose trees 
concealed them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<p>I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her 
since she left: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to
ask after her, and wouldn&rsquo;t let me pass.&nbsp; He said Mrs.
Linton was &lsquo;thrang,&rsquo; and the master was not in.&nbsp;
Zillah has told me something of the way they go on, otherwise I 
should hardly know who was dead and who living.&nbsp; She thinks 
Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her 
talk.&nbsp; My young lady asked some aid of her when she first 
came; but Mr. Heathcliff told her to follow her own business, and
let his daughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly 
acquiesced, being a narrow-minded, selfish woman.&nbsp; Catherine
evinced a child&rsquo;s annoyance at this neglect; repaid it with
contempt, and thus enlisted my informant among her enemies, as 
securely as if she had done her some great wrong.&nbsp; I had a 
long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a little before you 
came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; and this is what 
she told me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The first thing Mrs. Linton did,&rsquo; she said, 
&lsquo;on her arrival at the Heights, was to run up-stairs, 
without even wishing good-evening to me and Joseph; she shut 
herself into Linton&rsquo;s room, and remained till 
morning.&nbsp; Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at 
breakfast, she entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if 
the doctor might be sent for? her cousin was very ill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We know that!&rdquo; answered Heathcliff; 
&ldquo;but his life is not worth a farthing, and I won&rsquo;t 
spend a farthing on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But I cannot tell how to do,&rdquo; she said; 
&ldquo;and if nobody will help me, he&rsquo;ll die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Walk out of the room,&rdquo; cried the master, 
&ldquo;and let me never hear a word more about him!&nbsp; None 
here care what becomes of him; if you do, act the nurse; if you 
do not, lock him up and leave him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then she began to bother me, and I said I&rsquo;d had 
enough plague with the tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and
hers was to wait on Linton: Mr. Heathcliff bid me leave that 
labour to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How they managed together, I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; I 
fancy he fretted a great deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; 
and she had precious little rest: one could guess by her white 
face and heavy eyes.&nbsp; She sometimes came into the kitchen 
all wildered like, and looked as if she would fain beg 
assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never 
dare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that 
Kenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either 
to advise or complain, and I always refused to meddle.&nbsp; Once
or twice, after we had gone to bed, I&rsquo;ve happened to open 
my door again and seen her sitting crying on the 
stairs&rsquo;-top; and then I&rsquo;ve shut myself in quick, for 
fear of being moved to interfere.&nbsp; I did pity her then, 
I&rsquo;m sure: still I didn&rsquo;t wish to lose my place, you 
know.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and
frightened me out of my wits, by saying, &ldquo;Tell Mr. 
Heathcliff that his son is dying&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he is, this
time.&nbsp; Get up, instantly, and tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Having uttered this speech, she vanished again.&nbsp; I
lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling.&nbsp; Nothing 
stirred&mdash;the house was quiet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s mistaken, I said to myself.&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;s got over it.&nbsp; I needn&rsquo;t disturb them; and I
began to doze.&nbsp; But my sleep was marred a second time by a 
sharp ringing of the bell&mdash;the only bell we have, put up on 
purpose for Linton; and the master called to me to see what was 
the matter, and inform them that he wouldn&rsquo;t have that 
noise repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I delivered Catherine&rsquo;s message.&nbsp; He cursed 
to himself, and in a few minutes came out with a lighted candle, 
and proceeded to their room.&nbsp; I followed.&nbsp; Mrs. 
Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands folded on 
her knees.&nbsp; Her father-in-law went up, held the light to 
Linton&rsquo;s face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards 
he turned to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Now&mdash;Catherine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how 
do you feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was dumb.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How do you feel, Catherine?&rdquo; he 
repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe, and I&rsquo;m free,&rdquo; she 
answered: &ldquo;I should feel well&mdash;but,&rdquo; she 
continued, with a bitterness she couldn&rsquo;t conceal, 
&ldquo;you have left me so long to struggle against death alone, 
that I feel and see only death!&nbsp; I feel like 
death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she looked like it, too!&nbsp; I gave her a little 
wine.&nbsp; Hareton and Joseph, who had been wakened by the 
ringing and the sound of feet, and heard our talk from outside, 
now entered.&nbsp; Joseph was fain, I believe, of the lad&rsquo;s
removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was more 
taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton.&nbsp;
But the master bid him get off to bed again: we didn&rsquo;t want
his help.&nbsp; He afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his 
chamber, and told me to return to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff 
remained by herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come 
down to breakfast: she had undressed, and appeared going to 
sleep, and said she was ill; at which I hardly wondered.&nbsp; I 
informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he replied,&mdash;&ldquo;Well, let 
her be till after the funeral; and go up now and then to get her 
what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell 
me.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who 
visited her twice a day, and would have been rather more 
friendly, but her attempts at increasing kindness were proudly 
and promptly repelled.</p>
<p>Heathcliff went up once, to show her Linton&rsquo;s 
will.&nbsp; He had bequeathed the whole of his, and what had been
her, moveable property, to his father: the poor creature was 
threatened, or coaxed, into that act during her week&rsquo;s 
absence, when his uncle died.&nbsp; The lands, being a minor, he 
could not meddle with.&nbsp; However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed 
and kept them in his wife&rsquo;s right and his also: I suppose 
legally; at any rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, 
cannot disturb his possession.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody,&rsquo; said Zillah, &lsquo;ever approached her 
door, except that once, but I; and nobody asked anything about 
her.&nbsp; The first occasion of her coming down into the house 
was on a Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; She had cried out, when I 
carried up her dinner, that she couldn&rsquo;t bear any longer 
being in the cold; and I told her the master was going to 
Thrushcross Grange, and Earnshaw and I needn&rsquo;t hinder her 
from descending; so, as soon as she heard Heathcliff&rsquo;s 
horse trot off, she made her appearance, donned in black, and her
yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a Quaker: 
she couldn&rsquo;t comb them out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:&rsquo; 
the kirk, you know, has no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and
they call the Methodists&rsquo; or Baptists&rsquo; place (I 
can&rsquo;t say which it is) at Gimmerton, a chapel.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Joseph had gone,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;but I 
thought proper to bide at home.&nbsp; Young folks are always the 
better for an elder&rsquo;s over-looking; and Hareton, with all 
his bashfulness, isn&rsquo;t a model of nice behaviour.&nbsp; I 
let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and 
she had been always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had 
as good leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she 
stayed.&nbsp; He coloured up at the news, and cast his eyes over 
his hands and clothes.&nbsp; The train-oil and gunpowder were 
shoved out of sight in a minute.&nbsp; I saw he meant to give her
his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted to be 
presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master 
is by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his 
confusion.&nbsp; He grew sullen, and began to swear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Mrs. Dean,&rsquo; Zillah went on, seeing me not 
pleased by her manner, &lsquo;you happen think your young lady 
too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen you&rsquo;re right: but I 
own I should love well to bring her pride a peg lower.&nbsp; And 
what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her, 
now?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s as poor as you or I: poorer, I&rsquo;ll be
bound: you&rsquo;re saying, and I&rsquo;m doing my little all 
that road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered 
him into a good humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting 
her former insults, he tried to make himself agreeable, by the 
housekeeper&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Missis walked in,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;as chill as 
an icicle, and as high as a princess.&nbsp; I got up and offered 
her my seat in the arm-chair.&nbsp; No, she turned up her nose at
my civility.&nbsp; Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come to the 
settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was 
starved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been starved a month and more,&rdquo;
she answered, resting on the word as scornful as she could.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a 
distance from both of us.&nbsp; Having sat till she was warm, she
began to look round, and discovered a number of books on the 
dresser; she was instantly upon her feet again, stretching to 
reach them: but they were too high up.&nbsp; Her cousin, after 
watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage to help
her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that 
came to hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was a great advance for the lad.&nbsp; She 
didn&rsquo;t thank him; still, he felt gratified that she had 
accepted his assistance, and ventured to stand behind as she 
examined them, and even to stoop and point out what struck his 
fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was he 
daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his 
finger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back and 
looking at her instead of the book.&nbsp; She continued reading, 
or seeking for something to read.&nbsp; His attention became, by 
degrees, quite centred in the study of her thick silky curls: her
face he couldn&rsquo;t see, and she couldn&rsquo;t see him.&nbsp;
And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but attracted like 
a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring to 
touching; he put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as 
if it were a bird.&nbsp; He might have stuck a knife into her 
neck, she started round in such a taking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Get away this moment!&nbsp; How dare you touch 
me?&nbsp; Why are you stopping there?&rdquo; she cried, in a tone
of disgust.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t endure you!&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll go upstairs again, if you come near me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could 
do: he sat down in the settle very quiet, and she continued 
turning over her volumes another half hour; finally, Earnshaw 
crossed over, and whispered to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah?&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m stalled of doing naught; and I do like&mdash;I could 
like to hear her!&nbsp; Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask of 
yourseln.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, 
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I said, immediately.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d 
take it very kind&mdash;he&rsquo;d be much obliged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She frowned; and looking up, answered&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be 
good enough to understand that I reject any pretence at kindness 
you have the hypocrisy to offer!&nbsp; I despise you, and will 
have nothing to say to any of you!&nbsp; When I would have given 
my life for one kind word, even to see one of your faces, you all
kept off.&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t complain to you!&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m driven down here by the cold; not either to amuse you 
or enjoy your society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What could I ha&rsquo; done?&rdquo; began 
Earnshaw.&nbsp; &ldquo;How was I to blame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh! you are an exception,&rdquo; answered Mrs. 
Heathcliff.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never missed such a concern as 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But I offered more than once, and asked,&rdquo; 
he said, kindling up at her pertness, &ldquo;I asked Mr. 
Heathcliff to let me wake for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Be silent!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go out of doors, or 
anywhere, rather than have your disagreeable voice in my 
ear!&rdquo; said my lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him! and 
unslinging his gun, restrained himself from his Sunday 
occupations no longer.&nbsp; He talked now, freely enough; and 
she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude: but the frost 
had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was forced to 
condescend to our company, more and more.&nbsp; However, I took 
care there should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever 
since, I&rsquo;ve been as stiff as herself; and she has no lover 
or liker among us: and she does not deserve one; for, let them 
say the least word to her, and she&rsquo;ll curl back without 
respect of any one.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll snap at the master 
himself, and as good as dares him to thrash her; and the more 
hurt she gets, the more venomous she grows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to
leave my situation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and
live with me: but Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he 
would set up Hareton in an independent house; and I can see no 
remedy, at present, unless she could marry again; and that scheme
it does not come within my province to arrange.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Thus ended Mrs. Dean&rsquo;s story.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the 
doctor&rsquo;s prophecy, I am rapidly recovering strength; and 
though it be only the second week in January, I propose getting 
out on horseback in a day or two, and riding over to Wuthering 
Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall spend the next six 
months in London; and, if he likes, he may look out for another 
tenant to take the place after October.&nbsp; I would not pass 
another winter here for much.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<p>Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty.&nbsp; I went to the 
Heights as I proposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a 
little note from her to her young lady, and I did not refuse, for
the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her 
request.&nbsp; The front door stood open, but the jealous gate 
was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and invoked Earnshaw
from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I entered.&nbsp;
The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen.&nbsp; I took 
particular notice of him this time; but then he does his best 
apparently to make the least of his advantages.</p>
<p>I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home?&nbsp; He answered, No;
but he would be in at dinner-time.&nbsp; It was eleven 
o&rsquo;clock, and I announced my intention of going in and 
waiting for him; at which he immediately flung down his tools and
accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute 
for the host.</p>
<p>We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself 
useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she
looked more sulky and less spirited than when I had seen her 
first.&nbsp; She hardly raised her eyes to notice me, and 
continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms 
of politeness as before; never returning my bow and good-morning 
by the slightest acknowledgment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She does not seem so amiable,&rsquo; I thought, 
&lsquo;as Mrs. Dean would persuade me to believe.&nbsp; 
She&rsquo;s a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the 
kitchen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Remove them yourself,&rsquo; she said, 
pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and retiring to a 
stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of birds 
and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap.&nbsp; I 
approached her, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, 
as I fancied, adroitly dropped Mrs. Dean&rsquo;s note on to her 
knee, unnoticed by Hareton&mdash;but she asked aloud, &lsquo;What
is that?&rsquo;&nbsp; And chucked it off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at
the Grange,&rsquo; I answered; annoyed at her exposing my kind 
deed, and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my 
own.&nbsp; She would gladly have gathered it up at this 
information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it in his 
waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first.&nbsp; 
Thereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very 
stealthily, drew out her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to 
her eyes; and her cousin, after struggling awhile to keep down 
his softer feelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the 
floor beside her, as ungraciously as he could.&nbsp; Catherine 
caught and perused it eagerly; then she put a few questions to me
concerning the inmates, rational and irrational, of her former 
home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured in soliloquy:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to be riding Minny down there!&nbsp; I 
should like to be climbing up there!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m 
tired&mdash;I&rsquo;m <i>stalled</i>, Hareton!&rsquo;&nbsp; And 
she leant her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn
and half a sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness:
neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Heathcliff,&rsquo; I said, after sitting some time
mute, &lsquo;you are not aware that I am an acquaintance of 
yours? so intimate that I think it strange you won&rsquo;t come 
and speak to me.&nbsp; My housekeeper never wearies of talking 
about and praising you; and she&rsquo;ll be greatly disappointed 
if I return with no news of or from you, except that you received
her letter and said nothing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does Ellen like you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, very well,&rsquo; I replied, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must tell her,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;that I 
would answer her letter, but I have no materials for writing: not
even a book from which I might tear a leaf.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No books!&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you 
contrive to live here without them? if I may take the liberty to 
inquire.&nbsp; Though provided with a large library, I&rsquo;m 
frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books away, and I 
should be desperate!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was always reading, when I had them,&rsquo; said 
Catherine; &lsquo;and Mr. Heathcliff never reads; so he took it 
into his head to destroy my books.&nbsp; I have not had a glimpse
of one for weeks.&nbsp; Only once, I searched through 
Joseph&rsquo;s store of theology, to his great irritation; and 
once, Hareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room&mdash;some
Latin and Greek, and some tales and poetry: all old 
friends.&nbsp; I brought the last here&mdash;and you gathered 
them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of 
stealing!&nbsp; They are of no use to you; or else you concealed 
them in the bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody 
else shall.&nbsp; Perhaps <i>your</i> envy counselled Mr. 
Heathcliff to rob me of my treasures?&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve most 
of them written on my brain and printed in my heart, and you 
cannot deprive me of those!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation 
of his private literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant
denial of her accusations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of 
knowledge,&rsquo; I said, coming to his rescue.&nbsp; &lsquo;He 
is not <i>envious</i>, but <i>emulous</i> of your 
attainments.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be a clever scholar in a few 
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,&rsquo; 
answered Catherine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I hear him trying to spell 
and read to himself, and pretty blunders he makes!&nbsp; I wish 
you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday: it was 
extremely funny.&nbsp; I heard you; and I heard you turning over 
the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing 
because you couldn&rsquo;t read their explanations!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be 
laughed at for his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to 
remove it.&nbsp; I had a similar notion; and, remembering Mrs. 
Dean&rsquo;s anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the 
darkness in which he had been reared, I 
observed,&mdash;&lsquo;But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a 
commencement, and each stumbled and tottered on the threshold; 
had our teachers scorned instead of aiding us, we should stumble 
and totter yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to 
limit his acquirements: still, he has no right to appropriate 
what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me with his vile mistakes
and mispronunciations!&nbsp; Those books, both prose and verse, 
are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to have 
them debased and profaned in his mouth!&nbsp; Besides, of all, he
has selected my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, 
as if out of deliberate malice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hareton&rsquo;s chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured 
under a severe sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no 
easy task to suppress.&nbsp; I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea
of relieving his embarrassment, took up my station in the 
doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood.&nbsp; He 
followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared,
bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which he threw into 
Catherine&rsquo;s lap, exclaiming,&mdash;&lsquo;Take them!&nbsp; 
I never want to hear, or read, or think of them again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t have them now,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I shall connect them with you, and hate them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and 
read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, 
and threw it from her.&nbsp; &lsquo;And listen,&rsquo; she 
continued, provokingly, commencing a verse of an old ballad in 
the same fashion.</p>
<p>But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, 
and not altogether disapprovingly, a manual cheek given to her 
saucy tongue.&nbsp; The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt
her cousin&rsquo;s sensitive though uncultivated feelings, and a 
physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the 
account, and repaying its effects on the inflictor.&nbsp; He 
afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire.&nbsp; 
I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that 
sacrifice to spleen.&nbsp; I fancied that as they consumed, he 
recalled the pleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph 
and ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated from them; and I 
fancied I guessed the incitement to his secret studies 
also.&nbsp; He had been content with daily labour and rough 
animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path.&nbsp; Shame 
at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters 
to higher pursuits; and instead of guarding him from one and 
winning him to the other, his endeavours to raise himself had 
produced just the contrary result.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes that&rsquo;s all the good that such a brute as you 
can get from them!&rsquo; cried Catherine, sucking her damaged 
lip, and watching the conflagration with indignant eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d <i>better</i> hold your tongue, now,&rsquo;
he answered fiercely.</p>
<p>And his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced 
hastily to the entrance, where I made way for him to pass.&nbsp; 
But ere he had crossed the door-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up
the causeway, encountered him, and laying hold of his shoulder 
asked,&mdash;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s to do now, my lad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Naught, naught,&rsquo; he said, and broke away to enjoy
his grief and anger in solitude.</p>
<p>Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be odd if I thwart myself,&rsquo; he muttered, 
unconscious that I was behind him.&nbsp; &lsquo;But when I look 
for his father in his face, I find <i>her</i> every day 
more!&nbsp; How the devil is he so like?&nbsp; I can hardly bear 
to see him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in.&nbsp; 
There was a restless, anxious expression in his 
countenance.&nbsp; I had never remarked there before; and he 
looked sparer in person.&nbsp; His daughter-in-law, on perceiving
him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so 
that I remained alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. 
Lockwood,&rsquo; he said, in reply to my greeting; &lsquo;from 
selfish motives partly: I don&rsquo;t think I could readily 
supply your loss in this desolation.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve wondered 
more than once what brought you here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An idle whim, I fear, sir,&rsquo; was my answer; 
&lsquo;or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away.&nbsp; I 
shall set out for London next week; and I must give you warning 
that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross Grange beyond 
the twelve months I agreed to rent it.&nbsp; I believe I shall 
not live there any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed; you&rsquo;re tired of being banished from 
the world, are you?&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But if you be 
coming to plead off paying for a place you won&rsquo;t occupy, 
your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my due from 
any one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming to plead off nothing about it,&rsquo; 
I exclaimed, considerably irritated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Should you wish
it, I&rsquo;ll settle with you now,&rsquo; and I drew my 
note-book from my pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; he replied, coolly; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll 
leave sufficient behind to cover your debts, if you fail to 
return: I&rsquo;m not in such a hurry.&nbsp; Sit down and take 
your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his 
visit can generally be made welcome.&nbsp; Catherine bring the 
things in: where are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may get your dinner with Joseph,&rsquo; muttered 
Heathcliff, aside, &lsquo;and remain in the kitchen till he is 
gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no 
temptation to transgress.&nbsp; Living among clowns and 
misanthropists, she probably cannot appreciate a better class of 
people when she meets them.</p>
<p>With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and 
Hareton, absolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat 
cheerless meal, and bade adieu early.&nbsp; I would have departed
by the back way, to get a last glimpse of Catherine and annoy old
Joseph; but Hareton received orders to lead up my horse, and my 
host himself escorted me to the door, so I could not fulfil my 
wish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How dreary life gets over in that house!&rsquo; I 
reflected, while riding down the road.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a 
realisation of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would
have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I struck up an 
attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated together into
the stirring atmosphere of the town!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<p>1802.&mdash;This September I was invited to devastate the 
moors of a friend in the north, and on my journey to his abode, I
unexpectedly came within fifteen miles of Gimmerton.&nbsp; The 
ostler at a roadside public-house was holding a pail of water to 
refresh my horses, when a cart of very green oats, newly reaped, 
passed by, and he remarked,&mdash;&lsquo;Yon&rsquo;s frough 
Gimmerton, nah!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re allas three wick&rsquo; after
other folk wi&rsquo; ther harvest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gimmerton?&rsquo; I repeated&mdash;my residence in that
locality had already grown dim and dreamy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah!&nbsp;
I know.&nbsp; How far is it from this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Happen fourteen mile o&rsquo;er th&rsquo; hills; and a 
rough road,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange.&nbsp; 
It was scarcely noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass 
the night under my own roof as in an inn.&nbsp; Besides, I could 
spare a day easily to arrange matters with my landlord, and thus 
save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood 
again.&nbsp; Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to 
inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our 
beasts, we managed the distance in some three hours.</p>
<p>I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone.&nbsp; 
The grey church looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard 
lonelier.&nbsp; I distinguished a moor-sheep cropping the short 
turf on the graves.&nbsp; It was sweet, warm weather&mdash;too 
warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying
the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer 
August, I&rsquo;m sure it would have tempted me to waste a month 
among its solitudes.&nbsp; In winter nothing more dreary, in 
summer nothing more divine, than those glens shut in by hills, 
and those bluff, bold swells of heath.</p>
<p>I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for 
admittance; but the family had retreated into the back premises, 
I judged, by one thin, blue wreath, curling from the kitchen 
chimney, and they did not hear.&nbsp; I rode into the 
court.&nbsp; Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat knitting,
and an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a meditative
pipe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Mrs. Dean within?&rsquo; I demanded of the dame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mistress Dean?&nbsp; Nay!&rsquo; she answered, 
&lsquo;she doesn&rsquo;t bide here: shoo&rsquo;s up at th&rsquo; 
Heights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you the housekeeper, then?&rsquo; I continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eea, aw keep th&rsquo; hause,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m Mr. Lockwood, the master.&nbsp; Are 
there any rooms to lodge me in, I wonder?&nbsp; I wish to stay 
all night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;T&rsquo; maister!&rsquo; she cried in 
astonishment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whet, whoiver knew yah wur 
coming?&nbsp; Yah sud ha&rsquo; send word.&nbsp; They&rsquo;s 
nowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t&rsquo; place: nowt there 
isn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and
I entered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, 
moreover, that I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome 
apparition, I bade her be composed.&nbsp; I would go out for a 
walk; and, meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a 
sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to sleep in.&nbsp; 
No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were 
necessary.&nbsp; She seemed willing to do her best; though she 
thrust the hearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker,
and malappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I 
retired, confiding in her energy for a resting-place against my 
return.&nbsp; Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed 
excursion.&nbsp; An afterthought brought me back, when I had 
quitted the court.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All well at the Heights?&rsquo; I inquired of the 
woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eea, f&rsquo;r owt ee knaw!&rsquo; she answered, 
skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders.</p>
<p>I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but 
it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away
and made my exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a 
sinking sun behind, and the mild glory of a rising moon in 
front&mdash;one fading, and the other brightening&mdash;as I 
quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road branching off to 
Mr. Heathcliff&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; Before I arrived in sight 
of it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along 
the west: but I could see every pebble on the path, and every 
blade of grass, by that splendid moon.&nbsp; I had neither to 
climb the gate nor to knock&mdash;it yielded to my hand.&nbsp; 
That is an improvement, I thought.&nbsp; And I noticed another, 
by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers 
wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.</p>
<p>Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the 
case in a coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: 
the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat 
endurable.&nbsp; But the house of Wuthering Heights is so large 
that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its 
influence; and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed 
themselves not far from one of the windows.&nbsp; I could both 
see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and 
listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense 
of curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Con-<i>trary</i>!&rsquo; said a voice as sweet as a 
silver bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;That for the third time, you 
dunce!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to tell you again. Recollect, or
I&rsquo;ll pull your hair!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Contrary, then,&rsquo; answered another, in deep but 
softened tones. &lsquo;And now, kiss me, for minding so 
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, read it over first correctly, without a single 
mistake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, 
respectably dressed and seated at a table, having a book before 
him.&nbsp; His handsome features glowed with pleasure, and his 
eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white 
hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a smart slap on the
cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of 
inattention.&nbsp; Its owner stood behind; her light, shining 
ringlets blending, at intervals, with his brown looks, as she 
bent to superintend his studies; and her face&mdash;it was lucky 
he could not see her face, or he would never have been so 
steady.&nbsp; I could; and I bit my lip in spite, at having 
thrown away the chance I might have had of doing something 
besides staring at its smiting beauty.</p>
<p>The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the 
pupil claimed a reward, and received at least five kisses; which,
however, he generously returned.&nbsp; Then they came to the 
door, and from their conversation I judged they were about to 
issue out and have a walk on the moors.&nbsp; I supposed I should
be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw&rsquo;s heart, if not by his 
mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed my 
unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling very 
mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the 
kitchen.&nbsp; There was unobstructed admittance on that side 
also; and at the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and 
singing a song; which was often interrupted from within by harsh 
words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from musical 
accents.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d rayther, by th&rsquo; haulf, hev&rsquo; 
&rsquo;em swearing i&rsquo; my lugs fro&rsquo;h morn to neeght, 
nor hearken ye hahsiver!&rsquo; said the tenant of the kitchen, 
in answer to an unheard speech of Nelly&rsquo;s.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a blazing shame, that I cannot oppen t&rsquo; 
blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan, and all 
t&rsquo; flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th&rsquo;
warld!&nbsp; Oh! ye&rsquo;re a raight nowt; and shoo&rsquo;s 
another; and that poor lad &rsquo;ll be lost atween ye.&nbsp; 
Poor lad!&rsquo; he added, with a groan; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s 
witched: I&rsquo;m sartin on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Oh, Lord, judge 
&rsquo;em, for there&rsquo;s norther law nor justice among wer 
rullers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I 
suppose,&rsquo; retorted the singer.&nbsp; &lsquo;But wisht, old 
man, and read your Bible like a Christian, and never mind 
me.&nbsp; This is &ldquo;Fairy Annie&rsquo;s 
Wedding&rdquo;&mdash;a bonny tune&mdash;it goes to a 
dance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and 
recognising me directly, she jumped to her feet, 
crying&mdash;&lsquo;Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!&nbsp; How could
you think of returning in this way?&nbsp; All&rsquo;s shut up at 
Thrushcross Grange.&nbsp; You should have given us 
notice!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve arranged to be accommodated there, for as 
long as I shall stay,&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I depart 
again to-morrow.&nbsp; And how are you transplanted here, Mrs. 
Dean? tell me that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon
after you went to London, and stay till you returned.&nbsp; But, 
step in, pray! Have you walked from Gimmerton this 
evening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From the Grange,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;and while 
they make me lodging room there, I want to finish my business 
with your master; because I don&rsquo;t think of having another 
opportunity in a hurry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What business, sir?&rsquo; said Nelly, conducting me 
into the house. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone out at present, and 
won&rsquo;t return soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About the rent,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must 
settle,&rsquo; she observed; &lsquo;or rather with me.&nbsp; She 
has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I act for her: 
there&rsquo;s nobody else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I looked surprised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff&rsquo;s death, I 
see,&rsquo; she continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliff dead!&rsquo; I exclaimed, astonished.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;How long ago?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your 
hat, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&nbsp; Stop, you have 
had nothing to eat, have you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home.&nbsp; 
You sit down too. I never dreamt of his dying!&nbsp; Let me hear 
how it came to pass.&nbsp; You say you don&rsquo;t expect them 
back for some time&mdash;the young people?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;I have to scold them every evening for their 
late rambles: but they don&rsquo;t care for me.&nbsp; At least, 
have a drink of our old ale; it will do you good: you seem 
weary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard 
Joseph asking whether &lsquo;it warn&rsquo;t a crying scandal 
that she should have followers at her time of life?&nbsp; And 
then, to get them jocks out o&rsquo; t&rsquo; maister&rsquo;s 
cellar!&nbsp; He fair shaamed to &lsquo;bide still and see 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, 
bearing a reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with 
becoming earnestness.&nbsp; And afterwards she furnished me with 
the sequel of Heathcliff&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; He had a 
&lsquo;queer&rsquo; end, as she expressed it.</p>
<p>I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of 
your leaving us, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for 
Catherine&rsquo;s sake. My first interview with her grieved and 
shocked me: she had altered so much since our separation.&nbsp; 
Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a new mind 
about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me, and he was 
tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my 
sitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were 
obliged to see her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at 
this arrangement; and, by degrees, I smuggled over a great number
of books, and other articles, that had formed her amusement at 
the Grange; and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable 
comfort.&nbsp; The delusion did not last long.&nbsp; Catherine, 
contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable and restless.
For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the garden, and 
it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as 
spring drew on; for another, in following the house, I was forced
to quit her frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she 
preferred quarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at 
peace in her solitude.&nbsp; I did not mind their skirmishes: but
Hareton was often obliged to seek the kitchen also, when the 
master wanted to have the house to himself! and though in the 
beginning she either left it at his approach, or quietly joined 
in my occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing 
him&mdash;and though he was always as sullen and silent as 
possible&mdash;after a while, she changed her behaviour, and 
became incapable of letting him alone: talking at him; commenting
on his stupidity and idleness; expressing her wonder how he could
endure the life he lived&mdash;how he could sit a whole evening 
staring into the fire, and dozing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?&rsquo; 
she once observed, &lsquo;or a cart-horse?&nbsp; He does his 
work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What a blank, dreary 
mind he must have!&nbsp; Do you ever dream, Hareton?&nbsp; And, 
if you do, what is it about?&nbsp; But you can&rsquo;t speak to 
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth 
nor look again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s, perhaps, dreaming now,&rsquo; she 
continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;He twitched his shoulder as Juno twitches
hers.&nbsp; Ask him, Ellen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you up-stairs, 
if you don&rsquo;t behave!&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; He had not only 
twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist, as if tempted to use
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the 
kitchen,&rsquo; she exclaimed, on another occasion.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;He is afraid I shall laugh at him.&nbsp; Ellen, what do 
you think?&nbsp; He began to teach himself to read once; and, 
because I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he 
not a fool?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were not you naughty?&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;answer me 
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I was,&rsquo; she went on; &lsquo;but I did not
expect him to be so silly.&nbsp; Hareton, if I gave you a book, 
would you take it now?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll try!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it 
off, and muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her 
neck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I shall put it here,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;in 
the table-drawer; and I&rsquo;m going to bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and 
departed.&nbsp; But he would not come near it; and so I informed 
her in the morning, to her great disappointment.&nbsp; I saw she 
was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence: her 
conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving 
himself: she had done it effectually.&nbsp; But her ingenuity was
at work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other 
such stationary employments as I could not well do in the 
parlour, she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud 
to me.&nbsp; When Hareton was there, she generally paused in an 
interesting part, and left the book lying about: that she did 
repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a mule, and, instead of 
snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to smoking with 
Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of the 
fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked 
nonsense, as he would have called it, the younger doing his best 
to seem to disregard it.&nbsp; On fine evenings the latter 
followed his shooting expeditions, and Catherine yawned and 
sighed, and teased me to talk to her, and ran off into the court 
or garden the moment I began; and, as a last resource, cried, and
said she was tired of living: her life was useless.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society,
had almost banished Earnshaw from his apartment.&nbsp; Owing to 
an accident at the commencement of March, he became for some days
a fixture in the kitchen.&nbsp; His gun burst while out on the 
hills by himself; a splinter cut his arm, and he lost a good deal
of blood before he could reach home.&nbsp; The consequence was 
that, perforce, he was condemned to the fireside and 
tranquillity, till he made it up again.&nbsp; It suited Catherine
to have him there: at any rate, it made her hate her room 
up-stairs more than ever: and she would compel me to find out 
business below, that she might accompany me.</p>
<p>On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some 
cattle; and, in the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the
kitchen.&nbsp; Earnshaw sat, morose as usual, at the chimney 
corner, and my little mistress was beguiling an idle hour with 
drawing pictures on the window-panes, varying her amusement by 
smothered bursts of songs, and whispered ejaculations, and quick 
glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her 
cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the grate.&nbsp; 
At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting my 
light, she removed to the hearthstone.&nbsp; I bestowed little 
attention on her proceedings, but, presently, I heard her 
begin&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found out, Hareton, that I 
want&mdash;that I&rsquo;m glad&mdash;that I should like you to be
my cousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me, and so 
rough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hareton returned no answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?&rsquo; she 
continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get off wi&rsquo; ye!&rsquo; he growled, with 
uncompromising gruffness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me take that pipe,&rsquo; she said, cautiously 
advancing her hand and abstracting it from his mouth.</p>
<p>Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and 
behind the fire.&nbsp; He swore at her and seized another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;you must listen to me 
first; and I can&rsquo;t speak while those clouds are floating in
my face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you go to the devil!&rsquo; he exclaimed, 
ferociously, &lsquo;and let me be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she persisted, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t: I 
can&rsquo;t tell what to do to make you talk to me; and you are 
determined not to understand.&nbsp; When I call you stupid, I 
don&rsquo;t mean anything: I don&rsquo;t mean that I despise 
you.&nbsp; Come, you shall take notice of me, Hareton: you are my
cousin, and you shall own me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall have naught to do wi&rsquo; you and your mucky 
pride, and your damned mocking tricks!&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to hell, body and soul, before I look 
sideways after you again.&nbsp; Side out o&rsquo; t&rsquo; gate, 
now, this minute!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing 
her lip, and endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to 
conceal a growing tendency to sob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. 
Hareton,&rsquo; I interrupted, &lsquo;since she repents of her 
sauciness.&nbsp; It would do you a great deal of good: it would 
make you another man to have her for a companion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A companion!&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;when she hates me,
and does not think me fit to wipe her shoon!&nbsp; Nay, if it 
made me a king, I&rsquo;d not be scorned for seeking her 
good-will any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!&rsquo;
wept Cathy, no longer disguising her trouble.&nbsp; &lsquo;You 
hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does, and more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a damned liar,&rsquo; began Earnshaw: 
&lsquo;why have I made him angry, by taking your part, then, a 
hundred times? and that when you sneered at and despised me, 
and&mdash;Go on plaguing me, and I&rsquo;ll step in yonder, and 
say you worried me out of the kitchen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you took my part,&rsquo; she 
answered, drying her eyes; &lsquo;and I was miserable and bitter 
at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you to forgive me: 
what can I do besides?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her 
hand.&nbsp; He blackened and scowled like a thunder-cloud, and 
kept his fists resolutely clenched, and his gaze fixed on the 
ground.&nbsp; Catherine, by instinct, must have divined it was 
obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that prompted this dogged 
conduct; for, after remaining an instant undecided, she stooped 
and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss.&nbsp; The little rogue 
thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took her 
former station by the window, quite demurely.&nbsp; I shook my 
head reprovingly, and then she blushed and 
whispered&mdash;&lsquo;Well! what should I have done, 
Ellen?&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t shake hands, and he wouldn&rsquo;t
look: I must show him some way that I like him&mdash;that I want 
to be friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very
careful, for some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and 
when he did raise it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his 
eyes.</p>
<p>Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly 
in white paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and 
addressed it to &lsquo;Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,&rsquo; she desired 
me to be her ambassadress, and convey the present to its destined
recipient.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And tell him, if he&rsquo;ll take it, I&rsquo;ll come 
and teach him to read it right,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;and, if 
he refuse it, I&rsquo;ll go upstairs, and never tease him 
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by 
my employer.&nbsp; Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid 
it on his knee.&nbsp; He did not strike it off, either.&nbsp; I 
returned to my work.&nbsp; Catherine leaned her head and arms on 
the table, till she heard the slight rustle of the covering being
removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated herself beside 
her cousin.&nbsp; He trembled, and his face glowed: all his 
rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him: he could 
not summon courage, at first, to utter a syllable in reply to her
questioning look, and her murmured petition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say you forgive me, Hareton, do.&nbsp; You can make me 
so happy by speaking that little word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He muttered something inaudible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you&rsquo;ll be my friend?&rsquo; added Catherine, 
interrogatively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, you&rsquo;ll be ashamed of me every day of your 
life,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;and the more ashamed, the more 
you know me; and I cannot bide it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you won&rsquo;t be my friend?&rsquo; she said, 
smiling as sweet as honey, and creeping close up.</p>
<p>I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking 
round again, I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over 
the page of the accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty 
had been ratified on both sides; and the enemies were, 
thenceforth, sworn allies.</p>
<p>The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those 
and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till 
Joseph came home.&nbsp; He, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the
spectacle of Catherine seated on the same bench with Hareton 
Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his shoulder; and confounded at his
favourite&rsquo;s endurance of her proximity: it affected him too
deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night.&nbsp; 
His emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as he
solemnly spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it 
with dirty bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the 
day&rsquo;s transactions.&nbsp; At length he summoned Hareton 
from his seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tak&rsquo; these in to t&rsquo; maister, lad,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;and bide there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;s gang up to my own 
rahm.&nbsp; This hoile&rsquo;s neither mensful nor seemly for us:
we mun side out and seearch another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Catherine,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;we must 
&ldquo;side out&rdquo; too: I&rsquo;ve done my ironing.&nbsp; Are
you ready to go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not eight o&rsquo;clock!&rsquo; she answered, 
rising unwillingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hareton, I&rsquo;ll leave this book upon the 
chimney-piece, and I&rsquo;ll bring some more 
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak&rsquo; into 
th&rsquo; hahse,&rsquo; said Joseph, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;ll be 
mitch if yah find &rsquo;em agean; soa, yah may plase 
yerseln!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, 
smiling as she passed Hareton, went singing up-stairs: lighter of
heart, I venture to say, than ever she had been under that roof 
before; except, perhaps, during her earliest visits to 
Linton.</p>
<p>The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it 
encountered temporary interruptions.&nbsp; Earnshaw was not to be
civilized with a wish, and my young lady was no philosopher, and 
no paragon of patience; but both their minds tending to the same 
point&mdash;one loving and desiring to esteem, and the other 
loving and desiring to be esteemed&mdash;they contrived in the 
end to reach it.</p>
<p>You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; But now, I&rsquo;m glad you did 
not try.&nbsp; The crown of all my wishes will be the union of 
those two.&nbsp; I shall envy no one on their wedding day: there 
won&rsquo;t be a happier woman than myself in England!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<p>On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to 
follow his ordinary employments, and therefore remaining about 
the house, I speedily found it would be impracticable to retain 
my charge beside me, as heretofore.&nbsp; She got downstairs 
before me, and out into the garden, where she had seen her cousin
performing some easy work; and when I went to bid them come to 
breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of 
ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and they were busy 
planning together an importation of plants from the Grange.</p>
<p>I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished
in a brief half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of 
Joseph&rsquo;s eye, and she had just fixed her choice of a 
flower-bed in the midst of them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&nbsp; That will be all shown to the 
master,&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;the minute it is 
discovered.&nbsp; And what excuse have you to offer for taking 
such liberties with the garden?&nbsp; We shall have a fine 
explosion on the head of it: see if we don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Mr. 
Hareton, I wonder you should have no more wit than to go and make
that mess at her bidding!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten they were Joseph&rsquo;s,&rsquo; 
answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll tell him
I did it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff.&nbsp; I held the 
mistress&rsquo;s post in making tea and carving; so I was 
indispensable at table.&nbsp; Catherine usually sat by me, but 
to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I presently saw she would
have no more discretion in her friendship than she had in her 
hostility.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, mind you don&rsquo;t talk with and notice your 
cousin too much,&rsquo; were my whispered instructions as we 
entered the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will certainly annoy Mr. 
Heathcliff, and he&rsquo;ll be mad at you both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to,&rsquo; she answered.</p>
<p>The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking 
primroses in his plate of porridge.</p>
<p>He dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet
she went on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being 
provoked to laugh.&nbsp; I frowned, and then she glanced towards 
the master: whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his 
company, as his countenance evinced; and she grew serious for an 
instant, scrutinizing him with deep gravity.&nbsp; Afterwards she
turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at last, Hareton uttered a 
smothered laugh.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff started; his eye rapidly 
surveyed our faces, Catherine met it with her accustomed look of 
nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is well you are out of my reach,&rsquo; he 
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;What fiend possesses you to stare back at
me, continually, with those infernal eyes?&nbsp; Down with them! 
and don&rsquo;t remind me of your existence again.&nbsp; I 
thought I had cured you of laughing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was me,&rsquo; muttered Hareton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you say?&rsquo; demanded the master.</p>
<p>Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the 
confession.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff looked at him a bit, and then 
silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted musing.&nbsp; 
We had nearly finished, and the two young people prudently 
shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further disturbance 
during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door, revealing 
by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage committed 
on his precious shrubs was detected.&nbsp; He must have seen 
Cathy and her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for 
while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and 
rendered his speech difficult to understand, he began:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mun hev&rsquo; my wage, and I mun goa!&nbsp; I 
<i>hed</i> aimed to dee wheare I&rsquo;d sarved fur sixty year; 
and I thowt I&rsquo;d lug my books up into t&rsquo; garret, and 
all my bits o&rsquo; stuff, and they sud hev&rsquo; t&rsquo; 
kitchen to theirseln; for t&rsquo; sake o&rsquo; quietness.&nbsp;
It wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun, but I thowt I 
<i>could</i> do that!&nbsp; But nah, shoo&rsquo;s taan my garden 
fro&rsquo; me, and by th&rsquo; heart, maister, I cannot stand 
it!&nbsp; Yah may bend to th&rsquo; yoak an ye will&mdash;I noan 
used to &rsquo;t, and an old man doesn&rsquo;t sooin get used to 
new barthens.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rayther arn my bite an&rsquo; my 
sup wi&rsquo; a hammer in th&rsquo; road!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, now, idiot!&rsquo; interrupted Heathcliff, 
&lsquo;cut it short!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your grievance?&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly.&nbsp; 
She may thrust you into the coal-hole for anything I 
care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s noan Nelly!&rsquo; answered Joseph.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I sudn&rsquo;t shift for Nelly&mdash;nasty ill nowt as 
shoo is.&nbsp; Thank God! <i>shoo</i> cannot stale t&rsquo; sowl 
o&rsquo; nob&rsquo;dy!&nbsp; Shoo wer niver soa handsome, but 
what a body mud look at her &lsquo;bout winking.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
yon flaysome, graceless quean, that&rsquo;s witched our lad, 
wi&rsquo; her bold een and her forrard ways&mdash;till&mdash;Nay!
it fair brusts my heart!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s forgotten all 
I&rsquo;ve done for him, and made on him, and goan and riven up a
whole row o&rsquo; t&rsquo; grandest currant-trees i&rsquo; 
t&rsquo; garden!&rsquo; and here he lamented outright; unmanned 
by a sense of his bitter injuries, and Earnshaw&rsquo;s 
ingratitude and dangerous condition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the fool drunk?&rsquo; asked Mr. Heathcliff.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Hareton, is it you he&rsquo;s finding fault 
with?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve pulled up two or three bushes,&rsquo; 
replied the young man; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m going to set 
&rsquo;em again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why have you pulled them up?&rsquo; said the 
master.</p>
<p>Catherine wisely put in her tongue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We wanted to plant some flowers there,&rsquo; she 
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the only person to blame, for I 
wished him to do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who the devil gave <i>you</i> leave to touch a 
stick about the place?&rsquo; demanded her father-in-law, much 
surprised.&nbsp; &lsquo;And who ordered <i>you</i> to obey 
her?&rsquo; he added, turning to Hareton.</p>
<p>The latter was speechless; his cousin replied&mdash;&lsquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament, 
when you have taken all my land!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your land, insolent slut!&nbsp; You never had 
any,&rsquo; said Heathcliff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And my money,&rsquo; she continued; returning his angry
glare, and meantime biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her 
breakfast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get done, 
and begone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Hareton&rsquo;s land, and his money,&rsquo; pursued
the reckless thing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hareton and I are friends now; 
and I shall tell him all about you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose 
up, eyeing her all the while, with an expression of mortal 
hate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,&rsquo; she 
said; &lsquo;so you may as well sit down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, 
I&rsquo;ll strike him to hell,&rsquo; thundered Heathcliff.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Damnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse him against 
me?&nbsp; Off with her!&nbsp; Do you hear?&nbsp; Fling her into 
the kitchen!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let 
her come into my sight again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drag her away!&rsquo; he cried, savagely.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Are you staying to talk?&rsquo;&nbsp; And he approached to
execute his own command.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll not obey you, wicked man, any more,&rsquo; 
said Catherine; &lsquo;and he&rsquo;ll soon detest you as much as
I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wisht! wisht!&rsquo; muttered the young man, 
reproachfully; &lsquo;I will not hear you speak so to him.&nbsp; 
Have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you won&rsquo;t let him strike me?&rsquo; she 
cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, then,&rsquo; he whispered earnestly.</p>
<p>It was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, <i>you</i> go!&rsquo; he said to Earnshaw.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Accursed witch! this time she has provoked me when I could
not bear it; and I&rsquo;ll make her repent it for 
ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her 
looks, entreating him not to hurt her that once.&nbsp; 
Heathcliff&rsquo;s black eyes flashed; he seemed ready to tear 
Catherine in pieces, and I was just worked up to risk coming to 
the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers relaxed; he shifted his 
grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed intently in her 
face.&nbsp; Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a moment 
to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine, 
said, with assumed calmness&mdash;&lsquo;You must learn to avoid 
putting me in a passion, or I shall really murder you some 
time!&nbsp; Go with Mrs. Dean, and keep with her; and confine 
your insolence to her ears.&nbsp; As to Hareton Earnshaw, if I 
see him listen to you, I&rsquo;ll send him seeking his bread 
where he can get it!&nbsp; Your love will make him an outcast and
a beggar.&nbsp; Nelly, take her; and leave me, all of you!&nbsp; 
Leave me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to 
resist; the other followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to 
himself till dinner.&nbsp; I had counselled Catherine to dine 
up-stairs; but, as soon as he perceived her vacant seat, he sent 
me to call her.&nbsp; He spoke to none of us, ate very little, 
and went out directly afterwards, intimating that he should not 
return before evening.</p>
<p>The two new friends established themselves in the house during
his absence; where I heard Hareton sternly cheek his cousin, on 
her offering a revelation of her father-in-law&rsquo;s conduct to
his father.&nbsp; He said he wouldn&rsquo;t suffer a word to be 
uttered in his disparagement: if he were the devil, it 
didn&rsquo;t signify; he would stand by him; and he&rsquo;d 
rather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr.
Heathcliff.&nbsp; Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he 
found means to make her hold her tongue, by asking how she would 
like <i>him</i> to speak ill of her father?&nbsp; Then she 
comprehended that Earnshaw took the master&rsquo;s reputation 
home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger than reason 
could break&mdash;chains, forged by habit, which it would be 
cruel to attempt to loosen.&nbsp; She showed a good heart, 
thenceforth, in avoiding both complaints and expressions of 
antipathy concerning Heathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow 
that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and 
Hareton: indeed, I don&rsquo;t believe she has ever breathed a 
syllable, in the latter&rsquo;s hearing, against her oppressor 
since.</p>
<p>When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends 
again, and as busy as possible in their several occupations of 
pupil and teacher.&nbsp; I came in to sit with them, after I had 
done my work; and I felt so soothed and comforted to watch them, 
that I did not notice how time got on.&nbsp; You know, they both 
appeared in a measure my children: I had long been proud of one; 
and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of equal 
satisfaction.&nbsp; His honest, warm, and intelligent nature 
shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in 
which it had been bred; and Catherine&rsquo;s sincere 
commendations acted as a spur to his industry.&nbsp; His 
brightening mind brightened his features, and added spirit and 
nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same 
individual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at
Wuthering Heights, after her expedition to the Crags.&nbsp; While
I admired and they laboured, dusk drew on, and with it returned 
the master.&nbsp; He came upon us quite unexpectedly, entering by
the front way, and had a full view of the whole three, ere we 
could raise our heads to glance at him.&nbsp; Well, I reflected, 
there was never a pleasanter, or more harmless sight; and it will
be a burning shame to scold them.&nbsp; The red fire-light glowed
on their two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with 
the eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three 
and she eighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel and learn, 
that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober 
disenchanted maturity.</p>
<p>They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: 
perhaps you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely 
similar, and they are those of Catherine Earnshaw.&nbsp; The 
present Catherine has no other likeness to her, except a breadth 
of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her 
appear rather haughty, whether she will or not.&nbsp; With 
Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at all
times, <i>then</i> it was particularly striking; because his 
senses were alert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted 
activity.&nbsp; I suppose this resemblance disarmed Mr. 
Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in evident agitation; but it 
quickly subsided as he looked at the young man: or, I should say,
altered its character; for it was there yet.&nbsp; He took the 
book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then returned 
it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her 
companion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to 
depart also, but he bid me sit still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a poor conclusion, is it not?&rsquo; he observed,
having brooded awhile on the scene he had just witnessed: 
&lsquo;an absurd termination to my violent exertions?&nbsp; I get
levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses, and train myself 
to be capable of working like Hercules, and when everything is 
ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a slate off either
roof has vanished!&nbsp; My old enemies have not beaten me; now 
would be the precise time to revenge myself on their 
representatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me.&nbsp; 
But where is the use?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care for striking: I 
can&rsquo;t take the trouble to raise my hand!&nbsp; That sounds 
as if I had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine 
trait of magnanimity.&nbsp; It is far from being the case: I have
lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle
to destroy for nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I&rsquo;m
in its shadow at present.&nbsp; I take so little interest in my 
daily life that I hardly remember to eat and drink.&nbsp; Those 
two who have left the room are the only objects which retain a 
distinct material appearance to me; and that appearance causes me
pain, amounting to agony.&nbsp; About <i>her</i> I won&rsquo;t 
speak; and I don&rsquo;t desire to think; but I earnestly wish 
she were invisible: her presence invokes only maddening 
sensations.&nbsp; <i>He</i> moves me differently: and yet if I 
could do it without seeming insane, I&rsquo;d never see him 
again!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll perhaps think me rather inclined to 
become so,&rsquo; he added, making an effort to smile, &lsquo;if 
I try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and 
ideas he awakens or embodies.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll not talk of 
what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself, 
it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my
youth, not a human being; I felt to him in such a variety of 
ways, that it would have been impossible to have accosted him 
rationally.&nbsp; In the first place, his startling likeness to 
Catherine connected him fearfully with her.&nbsp; That, however, 
which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination, 
is actually the least: for what is not connected with her to me? 
and what does not recall her?&nbsp; I cannot look down to this 
floor, but her features are shaped in the flags!&nbsp; In every 
cloud, in every tree&mdash;filling the air at night, and caught 
by glimpses in every object by day&mdash;I am surrounded with her
image!&nbsp; The most ordinary faces of men and women&mdash;my 
own features&mdash;mock me with a resemblance.&nbsp; The entire 
world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, 
and that I have lost her!&nbsp; Well, Hareton&rsquo;s aspect was 
the ghost of my immortal love; of my wild endeavours to hold my 
right; my degradation, my pride, my happiness, and my 
anguish&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only 
it will let you know why, with a reluctance to be always alone, 
his society is no benefit; rather an aggravation of the constant 
torment I suffer: and it partly contributes to render me 
regardless how he and his cousin go on together.&nbsp; I can give
them no attention any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what do you mean by a <i>change</i>, Mr. 
Heathcliff?&rsquo; I said, alarmed at his manner: though he was 
neither in danger of losing his senses, nor dying, according to 
my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy; and, as to his 
reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark 
things, and entertaining odd fancies.&nbsp; He might have had a 
monomania on the subject of his departed idol; but on every other
point his wits were as sound as mine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not know that till it comes,&rsquo; he said; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m only half conscious of it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have no feeling of illness, have you?&rsquo; I 
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Nelly, I have not,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are not afraid of death?&rsquo; I pursued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Afraid?&nbsp; No!&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
have neither a fear, nor a presentiment, nor a hope of 
death.&nbsp; Why should I?&nbsp; With my hard constitution and 
temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to,
and probably <i>shall</i>, remain above ground till there is 
scarcely a black hair on my head.&nbsp; And yet I cannot continue
in this condition!&nbsp; I have to remind myself to 
breathe&mdash;almost to remind my heart to beat!&nbsp; And it is 
like bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do 
the slightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion 
that I notice anything alive or dead, which is not associated 
with one universal idea.&nbsp; I have a single wish, and my whole
being and faculties are yearning to attain it.&nbsp; They have 
yearned towards it so long, and so unwaveringly, that I&rsquo;m 
convinced it will be reached&mdash;and soon&mdash;because it has 
devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the anticipation of 
its fulfilment.&nbsp; My confessions have not relieved me; but 
they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of 
humour which I show.&nbsp; O God!&nbsp; It is a long fight; I 
wish it were over!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to 
himself, till I was inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, 
that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell.&nbsp; I 
wondered greatly how it would end.&nbsp; Though he seldom before 
had revealed this state of mind, even by looks, it was his 
habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it himself; but not a 
soul, from his general bearing, would have conjectured the 
fact.&nbsp; You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and at 
the period of which I speak, he was just the same as then; only 
fonder of continued solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in 
company.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<p>For some days after that evening Mr. Heathcliff shunned 
meeting us at meals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude
Hareton and Cathy.&nbsp; He had an aversion to yielding so 
completely to his feelings, choosing rather to absent himself; 
and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed sufficient sustenance
for him.</p>
<p>One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go 
downstairs, and out at the front door.&nbsp; I did not hear him 
re-enter, and in the morning I found he was still away.&nbsp; We 
were in April then: the weather was sweet and warm, the grass as 
green as showers and sun could make it, and the two dwarf 
apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom.&nbsp; After 
breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting 
with my work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she
beguiled Hareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, 
to dig and arrange her little garden, which was shifted to that 
corner by the influence of Joseph&rsquo;s complaints.&nbsp; I was
comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around, and the 
beautiful soft blue overhead, when my young lady, who had run 
down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border, 
returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr. Heathcliff was
coming in.&nbsp; &lsquo;And he spoke to me,&rsquo; she added, 
with a perplexed countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did he say?&rsquo; asked Hareton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He told me to begone as fast as I could,&rsquo; she 
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;But he looked so different from his usual 
look that I stopped a moment to stare at him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, almost bright and cheerful.&nbsp; No, 
<i>almost</i> nothing&mdash;<i>very much</i> excited, and wild, 
and glad!&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Night-walking amuses him, then,&rsquo; I remarked, 
affecting a careless manner: in reality as surprised as she was, 
and anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement; for to see 
the master looking glad would not be an every-day 
spectacle.&nbsp; I framed an excuse to go in.&nbsp; Heathcliff 
stood at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, 
certainly, he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that 
altered the aspect of his whole face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you have some breakfast?&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You must be hungry, rambling about all night!&rsquo;&nbsp;
I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not like to ask
directly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m not hungry,&rsquo; he answered, averting 
his head, and speaking rather contemptuously, as if he guessed I 
was trying to divine the occasion of his good humour.</p>
<p>I felt perplexed: I didn&rsquo;t know whether it were not a 
proper opportunity to offer a bit of admonition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it right to wander out of 
doors,&rsquo; I observed, &lsquo;instead of being in bed: it is 
not wise, at any rate this moist season.&nbsp; I daresay 
you&rsquo;ll catch a bad cold or a fever: you have something the 
matter with you now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing but what I can bear,&rsquo; he replied; 
&lsquo;and with the greatest pleasure, provided you&rsquo;ll 
leave me alone: get in, and don&rsquo;t annoy me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a 
cat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; I reflected to myself, &lsquo;we shall have
a fit of illness.&nbsp; I cannot conceive what he has been 
doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a 
heaped-up plate from my hands, as if he intended to make amends 
for previous fasting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve neither cold nor fever, Nelly,&rsquo; he 
remarked, in allusion to my morning&rsquo;s speech; &lsquo;and 
I&rsquo;m ready to do justice to the food you give me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, 
when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct.&nbsp; 
He laid them on the table, looked eagerly towards the window, 
then rose and went out.&nbsp; We saw him walking to and fro in 
the garden while we concluded our meal, and Earnshaw said 
he&rsquo;d go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we had 
grieved him some way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, is he coming?&rsquo; cried Catherine, when her 
cousin returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;but he&rsquo;s not 
angry: he seemed rarely pleased indeed; only I made him impatient
by speaking to him twice; and then he bid me be off to you: he 
wondered how I could want the company of anybody else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour 
or two he re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree 
calmer: the same unnatural&mdash;it was 
unnatural&mdash;appearance of joy under his black brows; the same
bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of 
smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or 
weakness, but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates&mdash;a strong 
thrilling, rather than trembling.</p>
<p>I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should?&nbsp;
And I exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;Have you heard any good news, Mr. 
Heathcliff?&nbsp; You look uncommonly animated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where should good news come from to me?&rsquo; he 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m animated with hunger; and, 
seemingly, I must not eat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your dinner is here,&rsquo; I returned; &lsquo;why 
won&rsquo;t you get it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want it now,&rsquo; he muttered, hastily:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wait till supper.&nbsp; And, Nelly, once for 
all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other away from 
me.&nbsp; I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this 
place to myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there some new reason for this banishment?&rsquo; I 
inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell me why you are so queer, Mr. 
Heathcliff?&nbsp; Where were you last night?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not 
putting the question through idle curiosity, 
but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are putting the question through very idle 
curiosity,&rsquo; he interrupted, with a laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yet 
I&rsquo;ll answer it.&nbsp; Last night I was on the threshold of 
hell.&nbsp; To-day, I am within sight of my heaven.&nbsp; I have 
my eyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me!&nbsp; And now 
you&rsquo;d better go!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll neither see nor hear 
anything to frighten you, if you refrain from prying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more 
perplexed than ever.</p>
<p>He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one 
intruded on his solitude; till, at eight o&rsquo;clock, I deemed 
it proper, though unsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to
him.&nbsp; He was leaning against the ledge of an open lattice, 
but not looking out: his face was turned to the interior 
gloom.&nbsp; The fire had smouldered to ashes; the room was 
filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so 
still, that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was 
distinguishable, but its ripples and its gurgling over the 
pebbles, or through the large stones which it could not 
cover.&nbsp; I uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the
dismal grate, and commenced shutting the casements, one after 
another, till I came to his.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must I close this?&rsquo; I asked, in order to rouse 
him; for he would not stir.</p>
<p>The light flashed on his features as I spoke.&nbsp; Oh, Mr. 
Lockwood, I cannot express what a terrible start I got by the 
momentary view!&nbsp; Those deep black eyes!&nbsp; That smile, 
and ghastly paleness!&nbsp; It appeared to me, not Mr. 
Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle 
bend towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, close it,&rsquo; he replied, in his familiar 
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;There, that is pure awkwardness!&nbsp; Why 
did you hold the candle horizontally?&nbsp; Be quick, and bring 
another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to 
Joseph&mdash;&lsquo;The master wishes you to take him a light and
rekindle the fire.&rsquo;&nbsp; For I dared not go in myself 
again just then.</p>
<p>Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he 
brought it back immediately, with the supper-tray in his other 
hand, explaining that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he 
wanted nothing to eat till morning.&nbsp; We heard him mount the 
stairs directly; he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber, but 
turned into that with the panelled bed: its window, as I 
mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get through; and 
it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion, of which
he had rather we had no suspicion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he a ghoul or a vampire?&rsquo; I mused.&nbsp; I had
read of such hideous incarnate demons.&nbsp; And then I set 
myself to reflect how I had tended him in infancy, and watched 
him grow to youth, and followed him almost through his whole 
course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of
horror.&nbsp; &lsquo;But where did he come from, the little dark 
thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?&rsquo; muttered 
Superstition, as I dozed into unconsciousness.&nbsp; And I began,
half dreaming, to weary myself with imagining some fit parentage 
for him; and, repeating my waking meditations, I tracked his 
existence over again, with grim variations; at last, picturing 
his death and funeral: of which, all I can remember is, being 
exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription 
for his monument, and consulting the sexton about it; and, as he 
had no surname, and we could not tell his age, we were obliged to
content ourselves with the single word, 
&lsquo;Heathcliff.&rsquo;&nbsp; That came true: we were.&nbsp; If
you enter the kirkyard, you&rsquo;ll read, on his headstone, only
that, and the date of his death.</p>
<p>Dawn restored me to common sense.&nbsp; I rose, and went into 
the garden, as soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were 
any footmarks under his window.&nbsp; There were none.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;He has stayed at home,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;and 
he&rsquo;ll be all right to-day.&rsquo;&nbsp; I prepared 
breakfast for the household, as was my usual custom, but told 
Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the master came down, for
he lay late.&nbsp; They preferred taking it out of doors, under 
the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.</p>
<p>On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below.&nbsp; He and 
Joseph were conversing about some farming business; he gave 
clear, minute directions concerning the matter discussed, but he 
spoke rapidly, and turned his head continually aside, and had the
same excited expression, even more exaggerated.&nbsp; When Joseph
quitted the room he took his seat in the place he generally 
chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him.&nbsp; He drew it 
nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at the 
opposite wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, 
up and down, with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager 
interest that he stopped breathing during half a minute 
together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come now,&rsquo; I exclaimed, pushing some bread 
against his hand, &lsquo;eat and drink that, while it is hot: it 
has been waiting near an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t notice me, and yet he smiled.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d 
rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Heathcliff! master!&rsquo; I cried, 
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t, for God&rsquo;s sake, stare as if you saw an 
unearthly vision.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, for God&rsquo;s sake, shout so 
loud,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Turn round, and tell me, 
are we by ourselves?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; was my answer; &lsquo;of course we 
are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite 
sure.&nbsp; With a sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in
front among the breakfast things, and leant forward to gaze more 
at his ease.</p>
<p>Now, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I 
regarded him alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something 
within two yards&rsquo; distance.&nbsp; And whatever it was, it 
communicated, apparently, both pleasure and pain in exquisite 
extremes: at least the anguished, yet raptured, expression of his
countenance suggested that idea.&nbsp; The fancied object was not
fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence, and,
even in speaking to me, were never weaned away.&nbsp; I vainly 
reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if he 
stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he
stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread, his fingers 
clenched before they reached it, and remained on the table, 
forgetful of their aim.</p>
<p>I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed 
attention from its engrossing speculation; till he grew 
irritable, and got up, asking why I would not allow him to have 
his own time in taking his meals? and saying that on the next 
occasion I needn&rsquo;t wait: I might set the things down and 
go.&nbsp; Having uttered these words he left the house, slowly 
sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the 
gate.</p>
<p>The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came.&nbsp; I 
did not retire to rest till late, and when I did, I could not 
sleep.&nbsp; He returned after midnight, and, instead of going to
bed, shut himself into the room beneath.&nbsp; I listened, and 
tossed about, and, finally, dressed and descended.&nbsp; It was 
too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a hundred idle 
misgivings.</p>
<p>I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff&rsquo;s step, restlessly 
measuring the floor, and he frequently broke the silence by a 
deep inspiration, resembling a groan.&nbsp; He muttered detached 
words also; the only one I could catch was the name of Catherine,
coupled with some wild term of endearment or suffering; and 
spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and earnest, 
and wrung from the depth of his soul.&nbsp; I had not courage to 
walk straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him 
from his reverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, 
stirred it, and began to scrape the cinders.&nbsp; It drew him 
forth sooner than I expected.&nbsp; He opened the door 
immediately, and said&mdash;&lsquo;Nelly, come here&mdash;is it 
morning?&nbsp; Come in with your light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is striking four,&rsquo; I answered.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You want a candle to take up-stairs: you might have lit 
one at this fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t wish to go up-stairs,&rsquo; he 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come in, and kindle <i>me</i> a fire, and do 
anything there is to do about the room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry 
any,&rsquo; I replied, getting a chair and the bellows.</p>
<p>He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching 
distraction; his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to
leave no space for common breathing between.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When day breaks I&rsquo;ll send for Green,&rsquo; he 
said; &lsquo;I wish to make some legal inquiries of him while I 
can bestow a thought on those matters, and while I can act 
calmly.&nbsp; I have not written my will yet; and how to leave my
property I cannot determine.&nbsp; I wish I could annihilate it 
from the face of the earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,&rsquo; I 
interposed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let your will be a while: you&rsquo;ll 
be spared to repent of your many injustices yet!&nbsp; I never 
expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at 
present, marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through 
your own fault.&nbsp; The way you&rsquo;ve passed these three 
last days might knock up a Titan.&nbsp; Do take some food, and 
some repose.&nbsp; You need only look at yourself in a glass to 
see how you require both.&nbsp; Your cheeks are hollow, and your 
eyes blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger and going 
blind with loss of sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I assure you it is through no settled 
designs.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do both, as soon as I possibly 
can.&nbsp; But you might as well bid a man struggling in the 
water rest within arms&rsquo; length of the shore!&nbsp; I must 
reach it first, and then I&rsquo;ll rest.&nbsp; Well, never mind 
Mr. Green: as to repenting of my injustices, I&rsquo;ve done no 
injustice, and I repent of nothing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m too happy; 
and yet I&rsquo;m not happy enough.&nbsp; My soul&rsquo;s bliss 
kills my body, but does not satisfy itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Happy, master?&rsquo; I cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Strange 
happiness!&nbsp; If you would hear me without being angry, I 
might offer some advice that would make you happier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; he asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,&rsquo; I said, 
&lsquo;that from the time you were thirteen years old you have 
lived a selfish, unchristian life; and probably hardly had a 
Bible in your hands during all that period.&nbsp; You must have 
forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have space to
search it now.&nbsp; Could it be hurtful to send for some 
one&mdash;some minister of any denomination, it does not matter 
which&mdash;to explain it, and show you how very far you have 
erred from its precepts; and how unfit you will be for its 
heaven, unless a change takes place before you die?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m rather obliged than angry, Nelly,&rsquo; he 
said, &lsquo;for you remind me of the manner in which I desire to
be buried.&nbsp; It is to be carried to the churchyard in the 
evening.&nbsp; You and Hareton may, if you please, accompany me: 
and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys my 
directions concerning the two coffins!&nbsp; No minister need 
come; nor need anything be said over me.&mdash;I tell you I have 
nearly attained <i>my</i> heaven; and that of others is 
altogether unvalued and uncovered by me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, 
and died by that means, and they refused to bury you in the 
precincts of the kirk?&rsquo; I said, shocked at his godless 
indifference.&nbsp; &lsquo;How would you like it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They won&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; he replied: &lsquo;if 
they did, you must have me removed secretly; and if you neglect 
it you shall prove, practically, that the dead are not 
annihilated!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring 
he retired to his den, and I breathed freer.&nbsp; But in the 
afternoon, while Joseph and Hareton were at their work, he came 
into the kitchen again, and, with a wild look, bid me come and 
sit in the house: he wanted somebody with him.&nbsp; I declined; 
telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner frightened 
me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be his companion 
alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you think me a fiend,&rsquo; he said, with 
his dismal laugh: &lsquo;something too horrible to live under a 
decent roof.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then turning to Catherine, who was 
there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he added, half 
sneeringly,&mdash;&lsquo;Will <i>you</i> come, chuck?&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll not hurt you.&nbsp; No! to you I&rsquo;ve made myself 
worse than the devil.&nbsp; Well, there is <i>one</i> who 
won&rsquo;t shrink from my company!&nbsp; By God! she&rsquo;s 
relentless.&nbsp; Oh, damn it!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s unutterably too 
much for flesh and blood to bear&mdash;even mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He solicited the society of no one more.&nbsp; At dusk he went
into his chamber.&nbsp; Through the whole night, and far into the
morning, we heard him groaning and murmuring to himself.&nbsp; 
Hareton was anxious to enter; but I bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, 
and he should go in and see him.&nbsp; When he came, and I 
requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found it 
locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned.&nbsp; He was better, and
would be left alone; so the doctor went away.</p>
<p>The following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down 
till day-dawn; and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I 
observed the master&rsquo;s window swinging open, and the rain 
driving straight in.&nbsp; He cannot be in bed, I thought: those 
showers would drench him through.&nbsp; He must either be up or 
out.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll make no more ado, I&rsquo;ll go boldly 
and look.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran
to unclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly 
pushing them aside, I peeped in.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcliff was 
there&mdash;laid on his back.&nbsp; His eyes met mine so keen and
fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile.&nbsp; I could not
think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with rain; 
the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still.&nbsp; The 
lattice, flapping to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on 
the sill; no blood trickled from the broken skin, and when I put 
my fingers to it, I could doubt no more: he was dead and 
stark!</p>
<p>I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his 
forehead; I tried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, 
that frightful, life-like gaze of exultation before any one else 
beheld it.&nbsp; They would not shut: they seemed to sneer at my 
attempts; and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered 
too!&nbsp; Taken with another fit of cowardice, I cried out for 
Joseph.&nbsp; Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but resolutely
refused to meddle with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Th&rsquo; divil&rsquo;s harried off his soul,&rsquo; he
cried, &lsquo;and he may hev&rsquo; his carcass into t&rsquo; 
bargin, for aught I care!&nbsp; Ech! what a wicked &rsquo;un he 
looks, girning at death!&rsquo; and the old sinner grinned in 
mockery.&nbsp; I thought he intended to cut a caper round the 
bed; but suddenly composing himself, he fell on his knees, and 
raised his hands, and returned thanks that the lawful master and 
the ancient stock were restored to their rights.</p>
<p>I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably 
recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness.&nbsp;
But poor Hareton, the most wronged, was the only one who really 
suffered much.&nbsp; He sat by the corpse all night, weeping in 
bitter earnest.&nbsp; He pressed its hand, and kissed the 
sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from 
contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which 
springs naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as 
tempered steel.</p>
<p>Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the 
master died.&nbsp; I concealed the fact of his having swallowed 
nothing for four days, fearing it might lead to trouble, and 
then, I am persuaded, he did not abstain on purpose: it was the 
consequence of his strange illness, not the cause.</p>
<p>We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as 
he wished.&nbsp; Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry
the coffin, comprehended the whole attendance.&nbsp; The six men 
departed when they had let it down into the grave: we stayed to 
see it covered.&nbsp; Hareton, with a streaming face, dug green 
sods, and laid them over the brown mould himself: at present it 
is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds&mdash;and I hope
its tenant sleeps as soundly.&nbsp; But the country folks, if you
ask them, would swear on the Bible that he <i>walks</i>: there 
are those who speak to having met him near the church, and on the
moor, and even within this house.&nbsp; Idle tales, you&rsquo;ll 
say, and so say I.&nbsp; Yet that old man by the kitchen fire 
affirms he has seen two on &rsquo;em looking out of his chamber 
window on every rainy night since his death:&mdash;and an odd 
thing happened to me about a month ago.&nbsp; I was going to the 
Grange one evening&mdash;a dark evening, threatening 
thunder&mdash;and, just at the turn of the Heights, I encountered
a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him; he was crying
terribly; and I supposed the lambs were skittish, and would not 
be guided.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter, my little man?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under 
t&rsquo; nab,&rsquo; he blubbered, &lsquo;un&rsquo; I darnut pass
&rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on so I 
bid him take the road lower down.&nbsp; He probably raised the 
phantoms from thinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the 
nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat.&nbsp; 
Yet, still, I don&rsquo;t like being out in the dark now; and I 
don&rsquo;t like being left by myself in this grim house: I 
cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift to 
the Grange.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are going to the Grange, then?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered Mrs. Dean, &lsquo;as soon as they 
are married, and that will be on New Year&rsquo;s Day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who will live here then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, 
a lad to keep him company.&nbsp; They will live in the kitchen, 
and the rest will be shut up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit 
it?&rsquo; I observed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Mr. Lockwood,&rsquo; said Nelly, shaking her 
head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe the dead are at peace: but it is not
right to speak of them with levity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were 
returning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>They</i> are afraid of nothing,&rsquo; I grumbled, 
watching their approach through the window.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Together, they would brave Satan and all his 
legions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a 
last look at the moon&mdash;or, more correctly, at each other by 
her light&mdash;I felt irresistibly impelled to escape them 
again; and, pressing a remembrance into the hand of Mrs. Dean, 
and disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness, I vanished 
through the kitchen as they opened the house-door; and so should 
have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his 
fellow-servant&rsquo;s gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately 
recognised me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a 
sovereign at his feet.</p>
<p>My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of
the kirk.&nbsp; When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had 
made progress, even in seven months: many a window showed black 
gaps deprived of glass; and slates jutted off here and there, 
beyond the right line of the roof, to be gradually worked off in 
coming autumn storms.</p>
<p>I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the 
slope next the moor: on middle one grey, and half buried in the 
heath; Edgar Linton&rsquo;s only harmonized by the turf and moss 
creeping up its foot; Heathcliff&rsquo;s still bare.</p>
<p>I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the 
moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the 
soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one 
could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that 
quiet earth.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
