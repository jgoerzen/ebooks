<h1><a name="silverblaze"></a>Adventure I. Silver Blaze</h1>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am afraid, Watson, that I
shall have to go,&#8221; said Holmes, as we sat down
together to our breakfast one morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&#160; Where to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Dartmoor; to King&#8217;s Pyland.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I was not surprised.&#160; Indeed,
my only wonder was that he had not already been mixed
up in this extraordinary case, which was the one topic
of conversation through the length and breadth of
England.&#160; For a whole day my companion had rambled
about the room with his chin upon his chest and his
brows knitted, charging and recharging his pipe with
the strongest black tobacco, and absolutely deaf to
any of my questions or remarks.&#160; Fresh editions
of every paper had been sent up by our news agent,
only to be glanced over and tossed down into a corner.&#160;
Yet, silent as he was, I knew perfectly well what
it was over which he was brooding.&#160; There was
but one problem before the public which could challenge
his powers of analysis, and that was the singular
disappearance of the favorite for the Wessex Cup,
and the tragic murder of its trainer.&#160; When, therefore,
he suddenly announced his intention of setting out
for the scene of the drama it was only what I had
both expected and hoped for.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I should be most happy to go
down with you if I should not be in the way,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear Watson, you would confer
a great favor upon me by coming.&#160; And I think
that your time will not be misspent, for there are
points about the case which promise to make it an
absolutely unique one.&#160; We have, I think, just
time to catch our train at Paddington, and I will go
further into the matter upon our journey.&#160; You
would oblige me by bringing with you your very excellent
field-glass.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">And so it happened that an hour or
so later I found myself in the corner of a first-class
carriage flying along en route for Exeter, while Sherlock
Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed in his ear-flapped
travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into the bundle of fresh
papers which he had procured at Paddington.&#160; We
had left Reading far behind us before he thrust the
last one of them under the seat, and offered me his
cigar-case.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We are going well,&#8221; said
he, looking out the window and glancing at his watch.&#160;
&#8220;Our rate at present is fifty-three and a half
miles an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not observed the quarter-mile posts,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Nor have I. But the telegraph
posts upon this line are sixty yards apart, and the
calculation is a simple one.&#160; I presume that you
have looked into this matter of the murder of John
Straker and the disappearance of Silver Blaze?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have seen what the Telegraph
and the Chronicle have to say.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is one of those cases where
the art of the reasoner should be used rather for
the sifting of details than for the acquiring of fresh
evidence.&#160; The tragedy has been so uncommon, so
complete and of such personal importance to so many
people, that we are suffering from a plethora of surmise,
conjecture, and hypothesis.&#160; The difficulty is
to detach the framework of fact&#8212;&#173;of absolute
undeniable fact&#8212;&#173;from the embellishments
of theorists and reporters.&#160; Then, having established
ourselves upon this sound basis, it is our duty to
see what inferences may be drawn and what are the
special points upon which the whole mystery turns.&#160;
On Tuesday evening I received telegrams from both Colonel
Ross, the owner of the horse, and from Inspector Gregory,
who is looking after the case, inviting my cooperation.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Tuesday evening!&#8221; I exclaimed.&#160;
&#8220;And this is Thursday morning.&#160; Why didn&#8217;t
you go down yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because I made a blunder, my
dear Watson&#8212;&#173;which is, I am afraid, a more
common occurrence than any one would think who only
knew me through your memoirs.&#160; The fact is that
I could not believe it possible that the most remarkable
horse in England could long remain concealed, especially
in so sparsely inhabited a place as the north of Dartmoor.&#160;
From hour to hour yesterday I expected to hear that
he had been found, and that his abductor was the murderer
of John Straker.&#160; When, however, another morning
had come, and I found that beyond the arrest of young
Fitzroy Simpson nothing had been done, I felt that
it was time for me to take action.&#160; Yet in some
ways I feel that yesterday has not been wasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have formed a theory, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;At least I have got a grip
of the essential facts of the case.&#160; I shall enumerate
them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much as
stating it to another person, and I can hardly expect
your <i>co</i>-<i>operation</i> if I do not show you the
position from which we start.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I lay back against the cushions, puffing
at my cigar, while Holmes, leaning forward, with his
long, thin forefinger checking off the points upon
the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch of the
events which had led to our journey.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Silver Blaze,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;is from the Somomy stock, and holds as brilliant
a record as his famous ancestor.&#160; He is now in
his fifth year, and has brought in turn each of the
prizes of the turf to Colonel Ross, his fortunate
owner.&#160; Up to the time of the catastrophe he was
the first favorite for the Wessex Cup, the betting
being three to one on him.&#160; He has always, however,
been a prime favorite with the racing public, and
has never yet disappointed them, so that even at those
odds enormous sums of money have been laid upon him.&#160;
It is obvious, therefore, that there were many people
who had the strongest interest in preventing Silver
Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag next
Tuesday.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The fact was, of course, appreciated
at King&#8217;s Pyland, where the Colonel&#8217;s
training-stable is situated.&#160; Every precaution
was taken to guard the favorite.&#160; The trainer,
John Straker, is a retired jockey who rode in Colonel
Ross&#8217;s colors before he became too heavy for
the weighing-chair.&#160; He has served the Colonel
for five years as jockey and for seven as trainer,
and has always shown himself to be a zealous and honest
servant.&#160; Under him were three lads; for the establishment
was a small one, containing only four horses in all.&#160;
One of these lads sat up each night in the stable,
while the others slept in the loft.&#160; All three
bore excellent characters.&#160; John Straker, who is
a married man, lived in a small villa about two hundred
yards from the stables.&#160; He has no children, keeps
one maid-servant, and is comfortably off.&#160; The
country round is very lonely, but about half a mile
to the north there is a small cluster of villas which
have been built by a Tavistock contractor for the
use of invalids and others who may wish to enjoy the
pure Dartmoor air.&#160; Tavistock itself lies two
miles to the west, while across the moor, also about
two miles distant, is the larger training establishment
of Mapleton, which belongs to Lord Backwater, and is
managed by Silas Brown.&#160; In every other direction
the moor is a complete wilderness, inhabited only
by a few roaming gypsies.&#160; Such was the general
situation last Monday night when the catastrophe occurred.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;On that evening the horses
had been exercised and watered as usual, and the stables
were locked up at nine o&#8217;clock.&#160; Two of the
lads walked up to the trainer&#8217;s house, where
they had supper in the kitchen, while the third, Ned
Hunter, remained on guard.&#160; At a few minutes after
nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to the stables
his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried mutton.&#160;
She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the
stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty
should drink nothing else.&#160; The maid carried a
lantern with her, as it was very dark and the path
ran across the open moor.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Edith Baxter was within thirty
yards of the stables, when a man appeared out of the
darkness and called to her to stop.&#160; As he stepped
into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern
she saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing,
dressed in a gray suit of <i>tweeds</i>, with a cloth
cap.&#160; He wore gaiters, and carried a heavy stick
with a knob to it.&#160; She was most impressed, however,
by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness
of his manner.&#160; His age, she thought, would be
rather over thirty than under it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Can you tell me where
I am?&#8217; he asked.&#160; &#8217;I had almost made
up my mind to sleep on the moor, when I saw the light
of your lantern.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You are close to the
King&#8217;s Pyland training-stables,&#8217; said she.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Oh, indeed!&#160; What
a stroke of luck!&#8217; he cried.&#160; &#8217;I understand
that a stable-boy sleeps there alone every night.&#160;
Perhaps that is his supper which you are carrying
to him.&#160; Now I am sure that you would not be too
proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?&#8217;
He took a piece of white paper folded up out of his
waistcoat pocket.&#160; &#8217;See that the boy has
this to-night, and you shall have the prettiest frock
that money can buy.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She was frightened by the earnestness
of his manner, and ran past him to the window through
which she was accustomed to hand the meals.&#160; It
was already opened, and Hunter was seated at the small
table inside.&#160; She had begun to tell him of what
had happened, when the stranger came up again.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Good-evening,&#8217;
said he, looking through the window.&#160; &#8217;I
wanted to have a word with you.&#8217;&#160; The girl
has sworn that as he spoke she noticed the corner
of the little paper packet protruding from his closed
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What business have you here?&#8217;
asked the lad.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s business
that may put something into your pocket,&#8217; said
the other.&#160; &#8217;You&#8217;ve two horses in
for the Wessex Cup&#8212;&#173;Silver Blaze and Bayard.&#160;
Let me have the straight tip and you won&#8217;t be
a loser.&#160; Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard
could give the other a hundred yards in five furlongs,
and that the stable have put their money on him?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;So, you&#8217;re one
of those damned touts!&#8217; cried the lad.&#160; &#8217;I&#8217;ll
show you how we serve them in King&#8217;s Pyland.&#8217;&#160;
He sprang up and rushed across the stable to unloose
the dog.&#160; The girl fled away to the house, but
as she ran she looked back and saw that the stranger
was leaning through the window.&#160; A minute later,
however, when Hunter rushed out with the hound he
was gone, and though he ran all round the buildings
he failed to find any trace of him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;One moment,&#8221; I asked.&#160;
&#8220;Did the stable-boy, when he ran out with the
dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Excellent, Watson, excellent!&#8221;
murmured my companion.&#160; &#8220;The importance
of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a special
wire to Dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up.&#160;
The boy locked the door before he left it.&#160; The
window, I may add, was not large enough for a man
to get through.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms
had returned, when he sent a message to the trainer
and told him what had occurred.&#160; Straker was excited
at hearing the account, although he does not seem to
have quite realized its true significance.&#160; It
left him, however, vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker,
waking at one in the morning, found that he was dressing.&#160;
In reply to her inquiries, he said that he could not
sleep on account of his anxiety about the horses,
and that he intended to walk down to the stables to
see that all was well.&#160; She begged him to remain
at home, as she could hear the rain pattering against
the window, but in spite of her entreaties he pulled
on his large mackintosh and left the house.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mrs. Straker awoke at seven
in the morning, to find that her husband had not yet
returned.&#160; She dressed herself hastily, called
the maid, and set off for the stables.&#160; The door
was open; inside, huddled together upon a chair, Hunter
was sunk in a state of absolute stupor, the favorite&#8217;s
stall was empty, and there were no signs of his trainer.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The two lads who slept in the
chaff-cutting loft above the harness-room were quickly
aroused.&#160; They had heard nothing during the night,
for they are both sound sleepers.&#160; Hunter was
obviously under the influence of some powerful drug,
and as no sense could be got out of him, he was left
to sleep it off while the two lads and the two women
ran out in search of the absentees.&#160; They still
had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken
out the horse for early exercise, but on ascending
the knoll near the house, from which all the neighboring
moors were visible, they not only could see no signs
of the missing favorite, but they perceived something
which warned them that they were in the presence of
a tragedy.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;About a quarter of a mile from
the stables John Straker&#8217;s overcoat was flapping
from a furze-bush.&#160; Immediately beyond there was
a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom
of this was found the dead body of the unfortunate
trainer.&#160; His head had been shattered by a savage
blow from some heavy weapon, and he was wounded on
the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut, inflicted
evidently by some very sharp instrument.&#160; It was
clear, however, that Straker had defended himself
vigorously against his assailants, for in his right
hand he held a small knife, which was clotted with
blood up to the handle, while in his left he clasped
a red and black silk cravat, which was recognized by
the maid as having been worn on the preceding evening
by the stranger who had visited the stables.&#160;
Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite
positive as to the ownership of the cravat.&#160; He
was equally certain that the same stranger had, while
standing at the window, drugged his curried mutton,
and so deprived the stables of their watchman.&#160;
As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs
in the mud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow
that he had been there at the time of the struggle.&#160;
But from that morning he has disappeared, and although
a large reward has been offered, and all the gypsies
of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of
him.&#160; Finally, an analysis has shown that the
remains of his supper left by the stable-lad contain
an appreciable quantity of powdered opium, while the
people at the house partook of the same dish on the
same night without any ill effect.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Those are the main facts of
the case, stripped of all surmise, and stated as baldly
as possible.&#160; I shall now recapitulate what the
police have done in the matter.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Inspector Gregory, to whom
the case has been committed, is an extremely competent
officer.&#160; W&#232;r&#233; he but gifted with imagination he
might rise to great heights in his profession.&#160;
On his arrival he promptly found and arrested the
man upon whom suspicion naturally rested.&#160; There
was little difficulty in finding him, for he inhabited
one of those villas which I have mentioned.&#160; His
name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson.&#160; He was
a man of excellent birth and education, who had squandered
a fortune upon the turf, and who lived now by doing
a little quiet and genteel book-making in the sporting
clubs of London.&#160; An examination of his betting-book
shows that bets to the amount of five thousand pounds
had been registered by him against the favorite.&#160;
On being arrested he volunteered that statement that
he had come down to Dartmoor in the hope of getting
some information about the King&#8217;s Pyland horses,
and also about Desborough, the second favorite, which
was in charge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton stables.&#160;
He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as described
upon the evening before, but declared that he had no
sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain
first-hand information.&#160; When confronted with
his cravat, he turned very pale, and was utterly unable
to account for its presence in the hand of the murdered
man.&#160; His wet clothing showed that he had been
out in the storm of the night before, and his stick,
which was a Penang-lawyer weighted with lead, was just
such a weapon as might, by repeated blows, have inflicted
the terrible injuries to which the trainer had succumbed.&#160;
On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person,
while the state of Straker&#8217;s knife would show
that one at least of his assailants must bear his mark
upon him.&#160; There you have it all in a nutshell,
Watson, and if you can give me any light I shall be
infinitely obliged to you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had listened with the greatest interest
to the statement which Holmes, with characteristic
clearness, had laid before me.&#160; Though most of
the facts were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently
appreciated their relative importance, nor their connection
to each other.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Is it not possible,&#8221;
I suggested, &#8220;that the incised wound upon Straker
may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive
struggles which follow any brain injury?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is more than possible; it
is probable,&#8221; said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;In that
case one of the main points in favor of the accused
disappears.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said I, &#8220;even
now I fail to understand what the theory of the police
can be.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am afraid that whatever theory
we state has very grave objections to it,&#8221; returned
my companion.&#160; &#8220;The police imagine, I take
it, that this Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the
lad, and having in some way obtained a duplicate key,
opened the stable door and took out the horse, with
the intention, apparently, of kidnapping him altogether.&#160;
His bridle is missing, so that Simpson must have put
this on.&#160; Then, having left the door open behind
him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when
he was either met or overtaken by the trainer.&#160;
A row naturally ensued.&#160; Simpson beat out the
trainer&#8217;s brains with his heavy stick without
receiving any injury from the small knife which Straker
used in self-defence, and then the thief either led
the horse on to some secret hiding-place, or else
it may have bolted during the struggle, and be now
wandering out on the moors.&#160; That is the case as
it appears to the police, and improbable as it is,
all other explanations are more improbable still.&#160;
However, I shall very quickly test the matter when
I am once upon the spot, and until then I cannot really
see how we can get much further than our present position.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It was evening before we reached the
little town of Tavistock, which lies, like the boss
of a shield, in the middle of the huge circle of Dartmoor.&#160;
Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the station&#8212;&#173;the
one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard
and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other
a small, alert person, very neat and dapper, in a
frock-coat and gaiters, with trim little side-whiskers
and an eye-glass.&#160; The latter was Colonel Ross,
the well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector Gregory,
a man who was rapidly making his name in the English
detective service.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am delighted that you have
come down, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said the Colonel.&#160;
&#8220;The Inspector here has done all that could possibly
be suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned
in trying to avenge poor Straker and in recovering
my horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have there been any fresh developments?&#8221;
asked Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am sorry to say that we have
made very little progress,&#8221; said the Inspector.&#160;
&#8220;We have an open carriage outside, and as you
would no doubt like to see the place before the light
fails, we might talk it over as we drive.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A minute later we were all seated
in a comfortable landau, and were rattling through
the quaint old Devonshire city.&#160; Inspector Gregory
was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks,
while Holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection.&#160;
Colonel Ross leaned back with his arms folded and
his hat tilted over his eyes, while I listened with
interest to the dialogue of the two detectives.&#160;
Gregory was formulating his theory, which was almost
exactly what Holmes had foretold in the train.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The net is drawn pretty close
round Fitzroy Simpson,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;and
I believe myself that he is our man.&#160; At the same
time I recognize that the evidence is purely circumstantial,
and that some new development may upset it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about Straker&#8217;s knife?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We have quite come to the conclusion
that he wounded himself in his fall.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My friend Dr. Watson made that
suggestion to me as we came down.&#160; If so, it would
tell against this man Simpson.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Undoubtedly.&#160; He has neither
a knife nor any sign of a wound.&#160; The evidence
against him is certainly very strong.&#160; He had a
great interest in the disappearance of the favorite.&#160;
He lies under suspicion of having poisoned the stable-boy,
he was undoubtedly out in the storm, he was armed
with a heavy stick, and his cravat was found in the
dead man&#8217;s hand.&#160; I really think we have
enough to go before a jury.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes shook his head.&#160; &#8220;A
clever counsel would tear it all to rags,&#8221; said
he.&#160; &#8220;Why should he take the horse out of
the stable?&#160; If he wished to injure it why could
he not do it there?&#160; Has a duplicate key been
found in his possession?&#160; What chemist sold him
the powdered opium?&#160; Above all, where could he,
a stranger to the district, hide a horse, and such
a horse as this?&#160; What is his own explanation as
to the paper which he wished the maid to give to the
stable-boy?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He says that it was a ten-pound
note.&#160; One was found in his purse.&#160; But your
other difficulties are not so formidable as they seem.&#160;
He is not a stranger to the district.&#160; He has
twice lodged at Tavistock in the summer.&#160; The
opium was probably brought from London.&#160; The key,
having served its purpose, would be hurled away.&#160;
The horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits
or old mines upon the moor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he say about the cravat?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He acknowledges that it is
his, and declares that he had lost it.&#160; But a
new element has been introduced into the case which
may account for his leading the horse from the stable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes pricked up his ears.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We have found traces which
show that a party of gypsies encamped on Monday night
within a mile of the spot where the murder took place.&#160;
On Tuesday they were gone.&#160; Now, presuming that
there was some understanding between Simpson and these
gypsies, might he not have been leading the horse
to them when he was overtaken, and may they not have
him now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is certainly possible.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The moor is being scoured for
these gypsies.&#160; I have also examined every stable
and out-house in Tavistock, and for a radius of ten
miles.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is another training-stable
quite close, I understand?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, and that is a factor which
we must certainly not neglect.&#160; As Desborough,
their horse, was second in the betting, they had an
interest in the disappearance of the favorite.&#160;
Silas Brown, the trainer, is known to have had large
bets upon the event, and he was no friend to poor
Straker.&#160; We have, however, examined the stables,
and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And nothing to connect this
man Simpson with the interests of the Mapleton stables?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing at all.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes leaned back in the carriage,
and the conversation ceased.&#160; A few minutes later
our driver pulled up at a neat little red-brick villa
with overhanging eaves which stood by the road.&#160;
Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long gray-tiled
out-building.&#160; In every other direction the low
curves of the moor, bronze-colored from the fading
ferns, stretched away to the sky-line, broken only
by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a cluster of
houses away to the westward which marked the Mapleton
stables.&#160; We all sprang out with the exception
of Holmes, who continued to lean back with his eyes
fixed upon the sky in front of him, entirely absorbed
in his own thoughts.&#160; It was only when I touched
his arm that he roused himself with a violent start
and stepped out of the carriage.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said he,
turning to Colonel Ross, who had looked at him in
some surprise.&#160; &#8220;I was day-dreaming.&#8221;&#160;
There was a gleam in his eyes and a suppressed excitement
in his manner which convinced me, used as I was to
his ways, that his hand was upon a clue, though I could
not imagine where he had found it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Perhaps you would prefer at
once to go on to the scene of the crime, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
said Gregory.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I think that I should prefer
to stay here a little and go into one or two questions
of detail.&#160; Straker was brought back here, I presume?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he lies upstairs.&#160; The inquest is
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been in your service some years, Colonel
Ross?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always found him an excellent servant.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I presume that you made an
inventory of what he had in his pockets at the time
of his death, Inspector?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have the things themselves
in the sitting-room, if you would care to see them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I should be very glad.&#8221;&#160;
We all filed into the front room and sat round the
central table while the Inspector unlocked a square
tin box and laid a small heap of things before us.&#160;
There was a box of <i>vestas</i>, two inches of tallow
candle, an A D P brier-root pipe, a pouch of seal-skin
with half an ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a silver
watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold,
an aluminum pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled
knife with a very delicate, inflexible blade marked
Weiss &#38; Co., London.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This is a very singular knife,&#8221;
said Holmes, lifting it up and examining it minutely.&#160;
&#8220;I presume, as I see blood-stains upon it, that
it is the one which was found in the dead man&#8217;s
grasp.&#160; Watson, this knife is surely in your line?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is what we call a cataract knife,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I thought so.&#160; A very delicate
blade devised for very delicate work.&#160; A strange
thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough expedition,
especially as it would not shut in his pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The tip was guarded by a disk
of cork which we found beside his body,&#8221; said
the Inspector.&#160; &#8220;His wife tells us that the
knife had lain upon the dressing-table, and that he
had picked it up as he left the room.&#160; It was
a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he could lay
his hands on at the moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;V&#233;ry possible.&#160; How about these papers?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Three of them are receipted
hay-dealers&#8217; accounts.&#160; One of them is a
letter of instructions from Colonel Ross.&#160; This
other is a milliner&#8217;s account for thirty-seven
pounds fifteen made out by Madame Lesurier, of Bond
Street, to William Derbyshire.&#160; Mrs. Straker tells
us that Derbyshire was a friend of her husband&#8217;s
and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Madam Derbyshire had somewhat
expensive tastes,&#8221; remarked Holmes, glancing
down the account.&#160; &#8220;Twenty-two guineas is
rather heavy for a single costume.&#160; However there
appears to be nothing more to learn, and we may now
go down to the scene of the crime.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As we emerged from the sitting-room
a woman, who had been waiting in the passage, took
a step forward and laid her hand upon the Inspector&#8217;s
sleeve.&#160; Her face was haggard and thin and eager,
stamped with the print of a recent horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got them?&#160; Have you found them?&#8221;
she panted.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No, Mrs. Straker.&#160; But
Mr. Holmes here has come from London to help us, and
we shall do all that is possible.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Surely I met you in Plymouth
at a garden-party some little time ago, Mrs. Straker?&#8221;
said Holmes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; you are mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Dear me!&#160; Why, I could
have sworn to it.&#160; You wore a costume of dove-colored
silk with ostrich-feather trimming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never had such a dress, sir,&#8221; answered
the lady.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, that quite settles it,&#8221;
said Holmes.&#160; And with an apology he followed
the Inspector outside.&#160; A short walk across the
moor took us to the hollow in which the body had been
found.&#160; At the brink of it was the furze-bush
upon which the coat had been hung.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There was no wind that night,
I understand,&#8221; said Holmes.</p>

<p>&#8220;None; but very heavy rain.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In that case the overcoat was
not blown against the furze-bush, but placed there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was laid across the bush.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You fill me with interest,
I perceive that the ground has been trampled up a
good deal.&#160; No doubt many feet have been here since
Monday night.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A piece of matting has been
laid here at the side, and we have all stood upon
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In this bag I have one of the
boots which Straker wore, one of Fitzroy Simpson&#8217;s
shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear Inspector, you surpass
yourself!&#8221; Holmes took the bag, and, descending
into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a more
central position.&#160; Then stretching himself upon
his face and leaning his chin upon his hands, he made
a careful study of the trampled mud in front of him.&#160;
&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; said he, suddenly.&#160; &#8220;What&#8217;s
this?&#8221; It was a wax vesta half burned, which
was so coated with mud that it looked at first like
a little chip of wood.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot think how I came to
overlook it,&#8221; said the Inspector, with an expression
of annoyance.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was invisible, buried in
the mud.&#160; I only saw it because I was looking
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#160; You expected to find it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it not unlikely.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He took the boots from the bag, and
compared the impressions of each of them with marks
upon the ground.&#160; Then he clambered up to the rim
of the hollow, and crawled about among the ferns and
bushes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am afraid that there are
no more tracks,&#8221; said the Inspector.&#160; &#8220;I
have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred
yards in each direction.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said Holmes,
rising.&#160; &#8220;I should not have the impertinence
to do it again after what you say.&#160; But I should
like to take a little walk over the moor before it
grows dark, that I may know my ground to-morrow, and
I think that I shall put this horseshoe into my pocket
for luck.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs
of impatience at my companion&#8217;s quiet and systematic
method of work, glanced at his watch.&#160; &#8220;I
wish you would come back with me, Inspector,&#8221;
said he.&#160; &#8220;There are several points on which
I should like your advice, and especially as to whether
we do not owe it to the public to remove our horse&#8217;s
name from the entries for the Cup.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; cried
Holmes, with decision.&#160; &#8220;I should let the
name stand.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The Colonel bowed.&#160; &#8220;I am
very glad to have had your opinion, sir,&#8221; said
he.&#160; &#8220;You will find us at poor Straker&#8217;s
house when you have finished your walk, and we can
drive together into Tavistock.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He turned back with the Inspector,
while Holmes and I walked slowly across the moor.&#160;
The sun was beginning to sink behind the stables of
Mapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front of us
was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy browns
where the faded ferns and brambles caught the evening
light.&#160; But the glories of the landscape were
all wasted upon my companion, who was sunk in the deepest
thought.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It&#8217;s this way, Watson,&#8221;
said he at last.&#160; &#8220;We may leave the question
of who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine
ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse.&#160;
Now, supposing that he broke away during or after
the tragedy, where could he have gone to?&#160; The
horse is a very gregarious creature.&#160; If left
to himself his instincts would have been either to
return to King&#8217;s Pyland or go over to Mapleton.&#160;
Why should he run wild upon the moor?&#160; He would
surely have been seen by now.&#160; And why should
gypsies kidnap him?&#160; These people always clear
out when they hear of trouble, for they do not wish
to be pestered by the police.&#160; They could not
hope to sell such a horse.&#160; They would run a great
risk and gain nothing by taking him.&#160; Surely that
is clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have already said that he
must have gone to King&#8217;s Pyland or to Mapleton.&#160;
He is not at King&#8217;s Pyland.&#160; Therefore he
is at Mapleton.&#160; Let us take that as a working
hypothesis and see what it leads us to.&#160; This
part of the moor, as the Inspector remarked, is very
hard and dry.&#160; But it falls away towards Mapleton,
and you can see from here that there is a long hollow
over yonder, which must have been very wet on Monday
night.&#160; If our supposition is correct, then the
horse must have crossed that, and there is the point
where we should look for his tracks.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We had been walking briskly during
this conversation, and a few more minutes brought
us to the hollow in question.&#160; At Holmes&#8217;
request I walked down the bank to the right, and he
to the left, but I had not taken fifty paces before
I heard him give a shout, and saw him waving his hand
to me.&#160; The track of a horse was plainly outlined
in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe which
he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;See the value of imagination,&#8221;
said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;It is the one quality which
Gregory lacks.&#160; We imagined what might have happened,
acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves justified.&#160;
Let us proceed.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We crossed the marshy bottom and passed
over a quarter of a mile of dry, hard turf.&#160; Again
the ground sloped, and again we came on the tracks.&#160;
Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick
them up once more quite close to Mapleton.&#160; It
was Holmes who saw them first, and he stood pointing
with a look of triumph upon his face.&#160; A man&#8217;s
track was visible beside the horse&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;The horse was alone before,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so.&#160; It was alone before.&#160; Hullo,
what is this?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The double track turned sharp off
and took the direction of King&#8217;s Pyland.&#160;
Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after it.&#160;
His eyes were on the trail, but I happened to look
a little to one side, and saw to my surprise the same
tracks coming back again in the opposite direction.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;One for you, Watson,&#8221;
said Holmes, when I pointed it out.&#160; &#8220;You
have saved us a long walk, which would have brought
us back on our own traces.&#160; Let us follow the
return track.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We had not to go far.&#160; It ended
at the paving of asphalt which led up to the gates
of the Mapleton stables.&#160; As we approached, a groom
ran out from them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want any loiterers about here,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I only wished to ask a question,&#8221;
said Holmes, with his finger and thumb in his waistcoat
pocket.&#160; &#8220;Should I be too early to see your
master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call at five
o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Bless you, sir, if any one
is about he will be, for he is always the first stirring.&#160;
But here he is, sir, to answer your questions for
himself.&#160; No, sir, no; it is as much as my place
is worth to let him see me touch your money.&#160;
Afterwards, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown
which he had drawn from his pocket, a fierce-looking
elderly man strode out from the gate with a hunting-crop
swinging in his hand.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What&#8217;s this, Dawson!&#8221;
he cried.&#160; &#8220;No gossiping!&#160; Go about your
business!&#160; And you, what the devil do you want
here?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ten minutes&#8217; talk with
you, my good sir,&#8221; said Holmes in the sweetest
of voices.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I&#8217;ve no time to talk
to every gadabout.&#160; We want no stranger here.&#160;
Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes leaned forward and whispered
something in the trainer&#8217;s ear.&#160; He started
violently and flushed to the temples.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;an
infernal lie!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;V&#233;ry good.&#160; Shall we argue
about it here in public or talk it over in your parlor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come in if you wish to.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes smiled.&#160; &#8220;I shall
not keep you more than a few minutes, Watson,&#8221;
said he.&#160; &#8220;Now, Mr. Brown, I am quite at
your disposal.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It was twenty minutes, and the reds
had all faded into grays before Holmes and the trainer
reappeared.&#160; Never have I seen such a change as
had been brought about in Silas Brown in that short
time.&#160; His face was ashy pale, beads of perspiration
shone upon his brow, and his hands shook until the
hunting-crop wagged like a branch in the wind.&#160;
His bullying, overbearing manner was all gone too,
and he cringed along at my companion&#8217;s side
like a dog with its master.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your instructions will be done.&#160;
It shall all be done,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There must be no mistake,&#8221;
said Holmes, looking round at him.&#160; The other
winced as he read the menace in his eyes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh no, there shall be no mistake.&#160;
It shall be there.&#160; Should I change it first or
not?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes thought a little and then burst
out laughing.&#160; &#8220;No, don&#8217;t,&#8221; said
he; &#8220;I shall write to you about it.&#160; No tricks,
now, or&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, I think I can.&#160; Well,
you shall hear from me to-morrow.&#8221;&#160; He turned
upon his heel, disregarding the trembling hand which
the other held out to him, and we set off for King&#8217;s
Pyland.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A more perfect compound of
the bully, coward, and sneak than Master Silas Brown
I have seldom met with,&#8221; remarked Holmes as we
trudged along together.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has the horse, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He tried to bluster out of
it, but I described to him so exactly what his actions
had been upon that morning that he is convinced that
I was watching him.&#160; Of course you observed the
peculiarly square toes in the impressions, and that
his own boots exactly corresponded to them.&#160; Again,
of course no subordinate would have dared to do such
a thing.&#160; I described to him how, when according
to his custom he was the first down, he perceived
a strange horse wandering over the moor.&#160; How he
went out to it, and his astonishment at recognizing,
from the white forehead which has given the favorite
its name, that chance had put in his power the only
horse which could beat the one upon which he had put
his money.&#160; Then I described how his first impulse
had been to lead him back to King&#8217;s Pyland,
and how the devil had shown him how he could hide the
horse until the race was over, and how he had led it
back and concealed it at Mapleton.&#160; When I told
him every detail he gave it up and thought only of
saving his own skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But his stables had been searched?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, an old horse-faker like him has many a
dodge.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But are you not afraid to leave
the horse in his power now, since he has every interest
in injuring it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear fellow, he will guard
it as the apple of his eye.&#160; He knows that his
only hope of mercy is to produce it safe.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Colonel Ross did not impress
me as a man who would be likely to show much mercy
in any case.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The matter does not rest with
Colonel Ross.&#160; I follow my own methods, and tell
as much or as little as I choose.&#160; That is the
advantage of being unofficial.&#160; I don&#8217;t
know whether you observed it, Watson, but the Colonel&#8217;s
manner has been just a trifle cavalier to me.&#160;
I am inclined now to have a little amusement at his
expense.&#160; Say nothing to him about the horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not without your permission.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And of course this is all quite
a minor point compared to the question of who killed
John Straker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will devote yourself to that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, we both go back to London
by the night train.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I was thunderstruck by my friend&#8217;s
words.&#160; We had only been a few hours in Devonshire,
and that he should give up an investigation which he
had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible
to me.&#160; Not a word more could I draw from him
until we were back at the trainer&#8217;s house.&#160;
The Colonel and the Inspector were awaiting us in
the parlor.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My friend and I return to town
by the night-express,&#8221; said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;We
have had a charming little breath of your beautiful
Dartmoor air.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The Inspector opened his eyes, and
the Colonel&#8217;s lip curled in a sneer.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;So you despair of arresting
the murderer of poor Straker,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes shrugged his shoulders.&#160;
&#8220;There are certainly grave difficulties in the
way,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;I have every hope,
however, that your horse will start upon Tuesday,
and I beg that you will have your jockey in readiness.&#160;
Might I ask for a photograph of Mr. John Straker?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The Inspector took one from an envelope
and handed it to him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear Gregory, you anticipate
all my wants.&#160; If I might ask you to wait here
for an instant, I have a question which I should like
to put to the maid.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I must say that I am rather
disappointed in our London consultant,&#8221; said
Colonel Ross, bluntly, as my friend left the room.&#160;
&#8220;I do not see that we are any further than when
he came.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;At least you have his assurance
that your horse will run,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, I have his assurance,&#8221;
said the Colonel, with a shrug of his shoulders.&#160;
&#8220;I should prefer to have the horse.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I was about to make some reply in
defence of my friend when he entered the room again.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Now, gentlemen,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;I am quite ready for Tavistock.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As we stepped into the carriage one
of the stable-lads held the door open for us.&#160;
A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he leaned
forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You have a few sheep in the
paddock,&#8221; he said.&#160; &#8220;Who attends to
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you noticed anything amiss with them of
late?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir, not of much account; but three of
them have gone lame, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I could see that Holmes was extremely
pleased, for he chuckled and rubbed his hands together.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A long shot, Watson; a very
long shot,&#8221; said he, pinching my arm.&#160; &#8220;Gregory,
let me recommend to your attention this singular epidemic
among the sheep.&#160; Drive on, coachman!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Colonel Ross still wore an expression
which showed the poor opinion which he had formed
of my companion&#8217;s ability, but I saw by the
Inspector&#8217;s face that his attention had been
keenly aroused.</p>

<p>&#8220;You consider that to be important?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exceedingly so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any point to which you would wish
to draw my attention?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dog did nothing in the night-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the curious incident,&#8221; remarked
Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">Four days later Holmes and I were
again in the train, bound for Winchester to see the
race for the Wessex Cup.&#160; Colonel Ross met us by
appointment outside the station, and we drove in his
drag to the course beyond the town.&#160; His face
was grave, and his manner was cold in the extreme.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen nothing of my horse,&#8221; said
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that you would know him when you
saw him?&#8221; asked Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">The Colonel was very angry.&#160; &#8220;I
have been on the turf for twenty years, and never
was asked such a question as that before,&#8221; said
he.&#160; &#8220;A child would know Silver Blaze, with
his white forehead and his mottled off-foreleg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is the betting?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, that is the curious part
of it.&#160; You could have got fifteen to one yesterday,
but the price has become shorter and shorter, until
you can hardly get three to one now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum!&#8221; said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;Somebody
knows something, that is clear.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As the drag drew up in the enclosure
near the grand stand I glanced at the card to see
the entries.</p>

<p align="justify">Wessex Plate [it ran] 50 sovs each
h ft with 1000 sovs added for four and five year olds.&#160;
Second, L300.&#160; Third, L200.&#160; New course (one
mile and five furlongs).&#160; Mr. Heath Newton&#8217;s
The Negro.&#160; Red cap.&#160; Cinnamon jacket.&#160;
Colonel Wardlaw&#8217;s Pugilist.&#160; Pink cap.&#160;
Blue and black jacket.&#160; Lord Backwater&#8217;s
Desborough.&#160; Yellow cap and sleeves.&#160; Colonel
Ross&#8217;s Silver Blaze.&#160; Black cap.&#160; Red
jacket.&#160; Duke of Balmoral&#8217;s Iris.&#160; Yellow
and black stripes.&#160; Lord Singleford&#8217;s Rasper.&#160;
Purple cap.&#160; Black sleeves.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We scratched our other one,
and put all hopes on your word,&#8221; said the Colonel.&#160;
&#8220;Why, what is that?&#160; Silver Blaze favorite?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Five to four against Silver
Blaze!&#8221; roared the ring.&#160; &#8220;Five to
four against Silver Blaze!&#160; Five to fifteen against
Desborough!&#160; Five to four on the field!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There are the numbers up,&#8221;
I cried.&#160; &#8220;They are all six there.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;All six there?&#160; Then my
horse is running,&#8221; cried the Colonel in great
agitation.&#160; &#8220;But I don&#8217;t see him.&#160;
My colors have not passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only five have passed.&#160; This must be he.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept
out from the weighing enclosure and cantered past
us, bearing on its back the well-known black and red
of the Colonel.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That&#8217;s not my horse,&#8221;
cried the owner.&#160; &#8220;That beast has not a white
hair upon its body.&#160; What is this that you have
done, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, well, let us see how
he gets on,&#8221; said my friend, imperturbably.&#160;
For a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass.&#160;
&#8220;Capital!&#160; An excellent start!&#8221; he
cried suddenly.&#160; &#8220;There they are, coming
round the curve!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">From our drag we had a superb view
as they came up the straight.&#160; The six horses
were so close together that a carpet could have covered
them, but half way up the yellow of the Mapleton stable
showed to the front.&#160; Before they reached us,
however, Desborough&#8217;s bolt was shot, and the
Colonel&#8217;s horse, coming away with a rush, passed
the post a good six lengths before its rival, the
Duke of Balmoral&#8217;s Iris making a bad third.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It&#8217;s my race, anyhow,&#8221;
gasped the Colonel, passing his hand over his eyes.&#160;
&#8220;I confess that I can make neither head nor tail
of it.&#160; Don&#8217;t you think that you have kept
up your mystery long enough, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Certainly, Colonel, you shall
know everything.&#160; Let us all go round and have
a look at the horse together.&#160; Here he is,&#8221;
he continued, as we made our way into the weighing
enclosure, where only owners and their friends find
admittance.&#160; &#8220;You have only to wash his face
and his leg in spirits of wine, and you will find
that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You take my breath away!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I found him in the hands of
a faker, and took the liberty of running him just
as he was sent over.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear sir, you have done
wonders.&#160; The horse looks very fit and well.&#160;
It never went better in its life.&#160; I owe you a
thousand apologies for having doubted your ability.&#160;
You have done me a great service by recovering my
horse.&#160; You would do me a greater still if you
could lay your hands on the murderer of John Straker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done so,&#8221; said Holmes quietly.</p>

<p align="justify">The Colonel and I stared at him in
amazement.&#160; &#8220;You have got him!&#160; Where
is he, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#160; Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In my company at the present moment.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The Colonel flushed angrily.&#160;
&#8220;I quite recognize that I am under obligations
to you, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I must
regard what you have just said as either a very bad
joke or an insult.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Sherlock Holmes laughed.&#160; &#8220;I
assure you that I have not associated you with the
crime, Colonel,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;The real
murderer is standing immediately behind you.&#8221;&#160;
He stepped past and laid his hand upon the glossy
neck of the thoroughbred.</p>

<p>&#8220;The horse!&#8221; cried both the Colonel and
myself.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, the horse.&#160; And it
may lessen his guilt if I say that it was done in
self-defence, and that John Straker was a man who was
entirely unworthy of your confidence.&#160; But there
goes the bell, and as I stand to win a little on this
next race, I shall defer a lengthy explanation until
a more fitting time.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We had the corner of a Pullman car
to ourselves that evening as we whirled back to London,
and I fancy that the journey was a short one to Colonel
Ross as well as to myself, as we listened to our companion&#8217;s
narrative of the events which had occurred at the Dartmoor
training-stables upon the Monday night, and the means
by which he had unravelled them.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I confess,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;that any theories which I had formed from the
newspaper reports were entirely erroneous.&#160; And
yet there were indications there, had they not been
overlaid by other details which concealed their true
import.&#160; I went to Devonshire with the conviction
that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although,
of course, I saw that the evidence against him was
by no means complete.&#160; It was while I was in the
carriage, just as we reached the trainer&#8217;s house,
that the immense significance of the curried mutton
occurred to me.&#160; You may remember that I was distrait,
and remained sitting after you had all alighted.&#160;
I was marvelling in my own mind how I could possibly
have overlooked so obvious a clue.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I confess,&#8221; said the
Colonel, &#8220;that even now I cannot see how it helps
us.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was the first link in my
chain of reasoning.&#160; Powdered opium is by no means
tasteless.&#160; The flavor is not disagreeable, but
it is perceptible.&#160; W&#232;r&#233; it mixed with any ordinary
dish the eater would undoubtedly detect it, and would
probably eat no more.&#160; A curry was exactly the
medium which would disguise this taste.&#160; By no
possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy
Simpson, have caused curry to be served in the trainer&#8217;s
family that night, and it is surely too monstrous a
coincidence to suppose that he happened to come along
with powdered opium upon the very night when a dish
happened to be served which would disguise the flavor.&#160;
That is unthinkable.&#160; Therefore Simpson becomes
eliminated from the case, and our attention centers
upon Straker and his wife, the only two people who
could have chosen curried mutton for supper that night.&#160;
The opium was added after the dish was set aside for
the stable-boy, for the others had the same for supper
with no ill effects.&#160; Which of them, then, had
access to that dish without the maid seeing them?</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Before deciding that question
I had grasped the significance of the silence of the
dog, for one true inference invariably suggests others.&#160;
The Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was kept
in the stables, and yet, though some one had been
in and had fetched out a horse, he had not barked
enough to arouse the two lads in the loft.&#160; Obviously
the midnight visitor was some one whom the dog knew
well.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I was already convinced, or
almost convinced, that John Straker went down to the
stables in the dead of the night and took out Silver
Blaze.&#160; For what purpose?&#160; For a dishonest
one, obviously, or why should he drug his own stable-boy?&#160;
And yet I was at a loss to know why.&#160; There have
been cases before now where trainers have made sure
of great sums of money by laying against their own
horses, through agents, and then preventing them from
winning by fraud.&#160; Sometimes it is a pulling jockey.&#160;
Sometimes it is some surer and subtler means.&#160;
What was it here?&#160; I hoped that the contents of
his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And they did so.&#160; You cannot
have forgotten the singular knife which was found
in the dead man&#8217;s hand, a knife which certainly
no sane man would choose for a weapon.&#160; It was,
as Dr. Watson told us, a form of knife which is used
for the most delicate operations known in surgery.&#160;
And it was to be used for a delicate operation that
night.&#160; You must know, with your wide experience
of turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible
to make a slight nick upon the tendons of a horse&#8217;s
ham, and to do it subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely
no trace.&#160; A horse so treated would develop a
slight lameness, which would be put down to a strain
in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to
foul play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Villain!&#160; Scoundrel!&#8221; cried the Colonel.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We have here the explanation
of why John Straker wished to take the horse out on
to the moor.&#160; So spirited a creature would have
certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it
felt the prick of the knife.&#160; It was absolutely
necessary to do it in the open air.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have been blind!&#8221; cried
the Colonel.&#160; &#8220;Of course that was why he
needed the candle, and struck the match.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Undoubtedly.&#160; But in examining
his belongings I was fortunate enough to discover
not only the method of the crime, but even its motives.&#160;
As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men
do not carry other people&#8217;s bills about in their
pockets.&#160; We have most of us quite enough to do
to settle our own.&#160; I at once concluded that Straker
was leading a double life, and keeping a second establishment.&#160;
The nature of the bill showed that there was a lady
in the case, and one who had expensive tastes.&#160;
Lib&#233;ral as you are with your servants, one can hardly
expect that they can buy twenty-guinea walking dresses
for their ladies.&#160; I questioned Mrs. Straker as
to the dress without her knowing it, and having satisfied
myself that it had never reached her, I made a note
of the milliner&#8217;s address, and felt that by
calling there with Straker&#8217;s photograph I could
easily dispose of the mythical Derbyshire.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;From that time on all was plain.&#160;
Straker had led out the horse to a hollow where his
light would be invisible.&#160; Simpson in his flight
had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it
up&#8212;&#173;with some idea, perhaps, that he might
use it in securing the horse&#8217;s leg.&#160; Once
in the hollow, he had got behind the horse and had
struck a light; but the creature frightened at the
sudden glare, and with the strange instinct of animals
feeling that some mischief was intended, had lashed
out, and the steel shoe had struck Straker full on
the forehead.&#160; He had already, in spite of the
rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate
task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh.&#160;
Do I make it clear?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; cried the
Colonel.&#160; &#8220;Wonderful!&#160; You might have
been there!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My final shot was, I confess
a very long one.&#160; It struck me that so astute
a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate
tendon-nicking without a little practice.&#160; What
could he practice on?&#160; My eyes fell upon the sheep,
and I asked a question which, rather to my surprise,
showed that my surmise was correct.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;When I returned to London I
called upon the milliner, who had recognized Straker
as an excellent customer of the name of Derbyshire,
who had a very dashing wife, with a strong partiality
for expensive dresses.&#160; I have no doubt that this
woman had plunged him over head and ears in debt,
and so led him into this miserable plot.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You have explained all but
one thing,&#8221; cried the Colonel.&#160; &#8220;Where
was the horse?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, it bolted, and was cared
for by one of your neighbors.&#160; We must have an
amnesty in that direction, I think.&#160; This is Clapham
Junction, if I am not mistaken, and we shall be in
Victoria in less than ten minutes.&#160; If you care
to smoke a cigar in our rooms, Colonel, I shall be
happy to give you any other details which might interest
you.&#8221;</p>

<h1><a name="yellowface"></a>Adventure II.&#160; The Yellow Face</h1>

<p align="justify">[In publishing these short sketches
based upon the numerous cases in which my companion&#8217;s
singular gifts have made us the listeners to, and
eventually the actors in, some strange drama, it is
only natural that I should dwell rather upon his successes
than upon his failures.&#160; And this not so much
for the sake of his reputation&#8212;&#173;for, indeed,
it was when he was at his wits&#8217; end that his
energy and his versatility were most admirable&#8212;&#173;but
because where he failed it happened too often that
no one else succeeded, and that the tale was left
forever without a conclusion.&#160; Now and again,
however, it chanced that even when he erred, the truth
was still discovered.&#160; I have noted of some half-dozen
cases of the kind; the Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual
and that which I am about to recount are the two which
present the strongest features of interest.]</p>

<p align="justify">Sherlock Holmes was a man who seldom
took exercise for exercise&#8217;s sake.&#160; Few
men were capable of greater muscular effort, and he
was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight
that I have ever seen; but he looked upon aimless
bodily exertion as a waste of energy, and he seldom
bestirred himself save when there was some professional
object to be served.&#160; Then he was absolutely untiring
and indefatigable.&#160; That he should have kept himself
in training under such circumstances is remarkable,
but his diet was usually of the sparest, and his habits
were simple to the verge of austerity.&#160; Save for
the occasional use of cocaine, he had no vices, and
he only turned to the drug as a protest against the
monotony of existence when cases were scanty and the
papers uninteresting.</p>

<p align="justify">One day in early spring he had so
far relaxed as to go for a walk with me in the Park,
where the first faint shoots of green were breaking
out upon the elms, and the sticky spear-heads of the
chestnuts were just beginning to burst into their
five-fold leaves.&#160; For two hours we rambled about
together, in silence for the most part, as befits two
men who know each other intimately.&#160; It was nearly
five before we were back in Baker Street once more.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Beg pardon, sir,&#8221; said
our page-boy, as he opened the door.&#160; &#8220;There&#8217;s
been a gentleman here asking for you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes glanced reproachfully at me.&#160;
&#8220;So much for afternoon walks!&#8221; said he.&#160;
&#8220;Has this gentleman gone, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ask him in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; he came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long did he wait?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Half an hour, sir.&#160; He
was a very restless gentleman, sir, a-walkin&#8217;
and a-stampin&#8217; all the time he was here.&#160;
I was waitin&#8217; outside the door, sir, and I could
hear him.&#160; At last he outs into the passage, and
he cries, &#8216;Is that man <i>never</i> <i>goin</i>&#8217;
to come?&#8217; Those were his very words, sir.&#160;
&#8216;You&#8217;ll only need to wait a little longer,&#8217;
says I.&#160; &#8217;Then I&#8217;ll wait in the open
air, for I feel half choked,&#8217; says he.&#160; &#8217;I&#8217;ll
be back before long.&#8217;&#160; And with that he
ups and he outs, and all I could say wouldn&#8217;t
hold him back.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, well, you did your best,&#8221;
said Holmes, as we walked into our room.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s
very annoying, though, Watson.&#160; I was badly in
need of a case, and this looks, from the man&#8217;s
impatience, as if it were of importance.&#160; Hullo!&#160;
That&#8217;s not your pipe on the table.&#160; He must
have left his behind him.&#160; A nice old brier with
a good long stem of what the tobacconists call amber.&#160;
I wonder how many real amber mouthpieces there are
in London?&#160; Some people think that a fly in it
is a sign.&#160; Well, he must have been disturbed
in his mind to leave a pipe behind him which he evidently
values highly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that he values it highly?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, I should put the original
cost of the pipe at seven and sixpence.&#160; Now it
has, you see, been twice mended, once in the wooden
stem and once in the amber.&#160; Each of these mends,
done, as you observe, with silver bands, must have
cost more than the pipe did originally.&#160; The man
must value the pipe highly when he prefers to patch
it up rather than buy a new one with the same money.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Anything else?&#8221; I asked,
for Holmes was turning the pipe about in his hand,
and staring at it in his peculiar pensive way.</p>

<p align="justify">He held it up and tapped on it with
his long, thin fore-finger, as a professor might who
was lecturing on a bone.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Pipes are occasionally of extraordinary
interest,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;Nothing has
more individuality, save perhaps watches and bootlaces.&#160;
The indications here, however, are neither very marked
nor very important.&#160; The owner is obviously a
muscular man, left-handed, with an excellent set of
teeth, careless in his habits, and with no need to
practise economy.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">My friend threw out the information
in a very offhand way, but I saw that he cocked his
eye at me to see if I had followed his reasoning.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You think a man must be well-to-do
if he smokes a seven-shilling pipe,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This is Grosvenor mixture at
eightpence an ounce,&#8221; Holmes answered, knocking
a little out on his palm.&#160; &#8220;As he might get
an excellent smoke for half the price, he has no need
to practise economy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the other points?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He has been in the habit of
lighting his pipe at lamps and gas-jets.&#160; You
can see that it is quite charred all down one side.&#160;
Of course a match could not have done that.&#160; Why
should a man hold a match to the side of his pipe?&#160;
But you cannot light it at a lamp without getting the
bowl charred.&#160; And it is all on the right side
of the pipe.&#160; From that I gather that he is a
left-handed man.&#160; You hold your own pipe to the
lamp, and see how naturally you, being right-handed,
hold the left side to the flame.&#160; You might do
it once the other way, but not as a constancy.&#160;
This has always been held so.&#160; Then he has bitten
through his amber.&#160; It takes a muscular, energetic
fellow, and one with a good set of teeth, to do that.&#160;
But if I am not mistaken I hear him upon the stair,
so we shall have something more interesting than his
pipe to study.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">An instant later our door opened,
and a tall young man entered the room.&#160; He was
well but quietly dressed in a dark-gray suit, and carried
a brown wide-awake in his hand.&#160; I should have
put him at about thirty, though he was really some
years older.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said
he, with some embarrassment; &#8220;I suppose I should
have knocked.&#160; Yes, of course I should have knocked.&#160;
The fact is that I am a little upset, and you must
put it all down to that.&#8221;&#160; He passed his
hand over his forehead like a man who is half dazed,
and then fell rather than sat down upon a chair.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I can see that you have not
slept for a night or two,&#8221; said Holmes, in his
easy, genial way.&#160; &#8220;That tries a man&#8217;s
nerves more than work, and more even than pleasure.&#160;
May I ask how I can help you?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I wanted your advice, sir.&#160;
I don&#8217;t know what to do and my whole life seems
to have gone to pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish to employ me as a consulting detective?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not that only.&#160; I want
your opinion as a judicious man&#8212;&#173;as a man
of the world.&#160; I want to know what I ought to
do next.&#160; I hope to God you&#8217;ll be able to
tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He spoke in little, sharp, jerky outbursts,
and it seemed to me that to speak at all was very
painful to him, and that his will all through was
overriding his inclinations.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It&#8217;s a very delicate
thing,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;One does not like
to speak of one&#8217;s domestic affairs to strangers.&#160;
It seems dreadful to discuss the conduct of one&#8217;s
wife with two men whom I have never seen before.&#160;
It&#8217;s horrible to have to do it.&#160; But I&#8217;ve
got to the end of my tether, and I must have advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Grant Munro&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
began Holmes.</p>

<p>Our visitor sprang from his chair.&#160; &#8220;What!&#8221;
he cried, &#8220;you know my name?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If you wish to preserve your
incognito,&#8221; said Holmes, smiling, &#8220;I would
suggest that you cease to write your name upon the
lining of your hat, or else that you turn the crown
towards the person whom you are addressing.&#160; I
was about to say that my friend and I have listened
to a good many strange secrets in this room, and that
we have had the good fortune to bring peace to many
troubled souls.&#160; I trust that we may do as much
for you.&#160; Might I beg you, as time may prove to
be of importance, to furnish me with the facts of
your case without further delay?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Our visitor again passed his hand
over his forehead, as if he found it bitterly hard.&#160;
From every gesture and expression I could see that
he was a reserved, self-contained man, with a dash
of pride in his nature, more likely to hide his wounds
than to expose them.&#160; Then suddenly, with a fierce
gesture of his closed hand, like one who throws reserve
to the winds, he began.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The facts are these, Mr. Holmes,&#8221;
said he.&#160; &#8220;I am a married man, and have
been so for three years.&#160; During that time my wife
and I have loved each other as fondly and lived as
happily as any two that ever were joined.&#160; We
have not had a difference, not one, in thought or word
or deed.&#160; And now, since last Monday, there has
suddenly sprung up a barrier between us, and I find
that there is something in her life and in her thought
of which I know as little as if she were the woman
who brushes by me in the street.&#160; We are estranged,
and I want to know why.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Now there is one thing that
I want to impress upon you before I go any further,
Mr. Holmes.&#160; Effie loves me.&#160; Don&#8217;t let
there be any mistake about that.&#160; She loves me
with her whole heart and soul, and never more than
now.&#160; I know it.&#160; I feel it.&#160; I don&#8217;t
want to argue about that.&#160; A man can tell easily
enough when a woman loves him.&#160; But there&#8217;s
this secret between us, and we can never be the same
until it is cleared.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Kindly let me have the facts,
Mr. Munro,&#8221; said Holmes, with some impatience.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I
know about Effie&#8217;s history.&#160; She was a widow
when I met her first, though quite young&#8212;&#173;only
twenty-five.&#160; Her name then was Mrs. Hebron.&#160;
She went out to America when she was young, and lived
in the town of Atlanta, where she married this Hebron,
who was a lawyer with a good practice.&#160; They had
one child, but the yellow fever broke out badly in
the place, and both husband and child died of it.&#160;
I have seen his death certificate.&#160; This sickened
her of America, and she came back to live with a maiden
aunt at Pinner, in Middlesex.&#160; I may mention that
her husband had left her comfortably off, and that
she had a capital of about four thousand five hundred
pounds, which had been so well invested by him that
it returned an average of seven per cent.&#160; She
had only been six months at Pinner when I met her;
we fell in love with each other, and we married a
few weeks afterwards.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am a hop merchant myself,
and as I have an income of seven or eight hundred,
we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice
eighty-pound-a-year villa at Norbury.&#160; Our little
place was very countrified, considering that it is
so close to town.&#160; We had an inn and two houses
a little above us, and a single cottage at the other
side of the field which faces us, and except those
there were no houses until you got half way to the
station.&#160; My business took me into town at certain
seasons, but in summer I had less to do, and then in
our country home my wife and I were just as happy
as could be wished.&#160; I tell you that there never
was a shadow between us until this accursed affair
began.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing I ought
to tell you before I go further.&#160; When we married,
my wife made over all her property to me&#8212;&#173;rather
against my will, for I saw how awkward it would be
if my business affairs went wrong.&#160; However, she
would have it so, and it was done.&#160; Well, about
six weeks ago she came to me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Jack,&#8217; said she,
&#8217;when you took my money you said that if ever
I wanted any I was to ask you for it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Certainly,&#8217; said I.&#160; &#8216;It&#8217;s
all your own.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; said she, &#8216;I want
a hundred pounds.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I was a bit staggered at this,
for I had imagined it was simply a new dress or something
of the kind that she was after.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What on earth for?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Oh,&#8217; said she,
in her playful way, &#8217;you said that you were only
my banker, and bankers never ask questions, you know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If you really mean it, of course you
shall have the money,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, yes, I really mean it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And you won&#8217;t tell me what you
want it for?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Some day, perhaps, but not just at present,
Jack.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;So I had to be content with
that, though it was the first time that there had
ever been any secret between us.&#160; I gave her a
check, and I never thought any more of the matter.&#160;
It may have nothing to do with what came afterwards,
but I thought it only right to mention it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, I told you just now that
there is a cottage not far from our house.&#160; There
is just a field between us, but to reach it you have
to go along the road and then turn down a lane.&#160;
Just beyond it is a nice little grove of <i>Scotch</i>
<i>firs</i>, and I used to be very fond of strolling
down there, for trees are always a neighborly kind
of things.&#160; The cottage had been standing empty
this eight months, and it was a pity, for it was a
pretty two-storied place, with an old-fashioned porch
and honeysuckle about it.&#160; I have stood many a
time and thought what a neat little homestead it would
make.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, last Monday evening I
was taking a stroll down that way, when I met an empty
van coming up the lane, and saw a pile of carpets and
things lying about on the grass-plot beside the porch.&#160;
It was clear that the cottage had at last been let.&#160;
I walked past it, and wondered what sort of folk they
were who had come to live so near us.&#160; And as I
looked I suddenly became aware that a face was watching
me out of one of the upper windows.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what there
was about that face, Mr. Holmes, but it seemed to
send a chill right down my back.&#160; I was some little
way off, so that I could not make out the features,
but there was something unnatural and inhuman about
the face.&#160; That was the impression that I had,
and I moved quickly forwards to get a nearer view
of the person who was watching me.&#160; But as I did
so the face suddenly disappeared, so suddenly that
it seemed to have been plucked away into the darkness
of the room.&#160; I stood for five minutes thinking
the business over, and trying to analyze my impressions.&#160;
I could not tell if the face were that of a man or
a woman.&#160; It had been too far from me for that.&#160;
But its color was what had impressed me most.&#160;
It was of a livid chalky white, and with something
set and rigid about it which was shockingly unnatural.&#160;
So disturbed was I that I determined to see a little
more of the new inmates of the cottage.&#160; I approached
and knocked at the door, which was instantly opened
by a tall, gaunt woman with a harsh, forbidding face.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;What may you be wantin&#8217;?&#8217;
she asked, in a Northern accent.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I am your neighbor over
yonder,&#8217; said I, nodding towards my house.&#160;
&#8217;I see that you have only just moved in, so
I thought that if I could be of any help to you in
any&#8212;&#173;&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Ay, we&#8217;ll just
ask ye when we want ye,&#8217; said she, and shut the
door in my face.&#160; Annoyed at the churlish rebuff,
I turned my back and walked home.&#160; All evening,
though I tried to think of other things, my mind would
still turn to the apparition at the window and the
rudeness of the woman.&#160; I determined to say nothing
about the former to my wife, for she is a nervous,
highly strung woman, and I had no wish that she would
share the unpleasant impression which had been produced
upon myself.&#160; I remarked to her, however, before
I fell asleep, that the cottage was now occupied,
to which she returned no reply.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am usually an extremely sound
sleeper.&#160; It has been a standing jest in the family
that nothing could ever wake me during the night.&#160;
And yet somehow on that particular night, whether
it may have been the slight excitement produced by
my little adventure or not I know not, but I slept
much more lightly than usual.&#160; Half in my dreams
I was dimly conscious that something was going on
in the room, and gradually became aware that my wife
had dressed herself and was slipping on her mantle
and her bonnet.&#160; My lips were parted to murmur
out some sleepy words of surprise or remonstrance
at this untimely preparation, when suddenly my half-opened
eyes fell upon her face, illuminated by the candle-light,
and astonishment held me dumb.&#160; She wore an expression
such as I had never seen before&#8212;&#173;such as
I should have thought her incapable of assuming.&#160;
She was deadly pale and breathing fast, glancing furtively
towards the bed as she fastened her mantle, to see
if she had disturbed me.&#160; Then, thinking that
I was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly from the
room, and an instant later I heard a sharp creaking
which could only come from the hinges of the front
door.&#160; I sat up in bed and rapped my knuckles
against the rail to make certain that I was truly awake.&#160;
Then I took my watch from under the pillow.&#160; It
was three in the morning.&#160; What on this earth
could my wife be doing out on the country road at three
in the morning?</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I had sat for about twenty
minutes turning the thing over in my mind and trying
to find some possible explanation.&#160; The more I
thought, the more extraordinary and inexplicable did
it appear.&#160; I was still puzzling over it when
I heard the door gently close again, and her footsteps
coming up the stairs.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Where in the world have
you been, Effie?&#8217; I asked as she entered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She gave a violent start and
a kind of gasping cry when I spoke, and that cry and
start troubled me more than all the rest, for there
was something indescribably guilty about them.&#160;
My wife had always been a woman of a frank, open nature,
and it gave me a chill to see her slinking into her
own room, and crying out and wincing when her own
husband spoke to her.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You awake, Jack!&#8217;
she cried, with a nervous laugh.&#160; &#8217;Why, I
thought that nothing could awake you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where have you been?&#8217; I asked,
more sternly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t wonder
that you are surprised,&#8217; said she, and I could
see that her fingers were trembling as she undid the
fastenings of her mantle.&#160; &#8217;Why, I never
remember having done such a thing in my life before.&#160;
The fact is that I felt as though I were choking,
and had a perfect longing for a breath of fresh air.&#160;
I really think that I should have fainted if I had
not gone out.&#160; I stood at the door for a few minutes,
and now I am quite myself again.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;All the time that she was telling
me this story she never once looked in my direction,
and her voice was quite unlike her usual tones.&#160;
It was evident to me that she was saying what was
false.&#160; I said nothing in reply, but turned my
face to the wall, sick at heart, with my mind filled
with a thousand venomous doubts and suspicions.&#160;
What was it that my wife was concealing from me?&#160;
Where had she been during that strange expedition?&#160;
I felt that I should have no peace until I knew, and
yet I shrank from asking her again after once she
had told me what was false.&#160; All the rest of the
night I tossed and tumbled, framing theory after theory,
each more unlikely than the last.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I should have gone to the City
that day, but I was too disturbed in my mind to be
able to pay attention to business matters.&#160; My
wife seemed to be as upset as myself, and I could
see from the little questioning glances which she
kept shooting at me that she understood that I disbelieved
her statement, and that she was at her wits&#8217;
end what to do.&#160; We hardly exchanged a word during
breakfast, and immediately afterwards I went out for
a walk, that I might think the matter out in the fresh
morning air.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I went as far as the Crystal
Palace, spent an hour in the grounds, and was back
in Norbury by one o&#8217;clock.&#160; It happened that
my way took me past the cottage, and I stopped for
an instant to look at the windows, and to see if I
could catch a glimpse of the strange face which had
looked out at me on the day before.&#160; As I stood
there, imagine my surprise, Mr. Holmes, when the door
suddenly opened and my wife walked out.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I was struck dumb with astonishment
at the sight of her; but my emotions were nothing
to those which showed themselves upon her face when
our eyes met.&#160; She seemed for an instant to wish
to shrink back inside the house again; and then, seeing
how useless all concealment must be, she came forward,
with a very white face and frightened eyes which belied
the smile upon her lips.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Ah, Jack,&#8217; she
said, &#8217;I have just been in to see if I can be
of any assistance to our new neighbors.&#160; Why do
you look at me like that, Jack?&#160; You are not angry
with me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;So,&#8217; said I, &#8216;this is where
you went during the night.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What do you mean?&#8217; she cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;You came here.&#160;
I am sure of it.&#160; Who are these people, that you
should visit them at such an hour?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have not been here before.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;How can you tell me
what you know is false?&#8217; I cried.&#160; &#8217;Your
very voice changes as you speak.&#160; When have I
ever had a secret from you?&#160; I shall enter that
cottage, and I shall probe the matter to the bottom.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;No, no, Jack, for God&#8217;s
sake!&#8217; she gasped, in uncontrollable emotion.&#160;
Then, as I approached the door, she seized my sleeve
and pulled me back with convulsive strength.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I implore you not to
do this, Jack,&#8217; she cried.&#160; &#8217;I swear
that I will tell you everything some day, but nothing
but misery can come of it if you enter that cottage.&#8217;&#160;
Then, as I tried to shake her off, she clung to me
in a frenzy of entreaty.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Trust me, Jack!&#8217;
she cried.&#160; &#8217;Trust me only this once.&#160;
You will never have cause to regret it.&#160; You know
that I would not have a secret from you if it were
not for your own sake.&#160; Our whole lives are at
stake in this.&#160; If you come home with me, all
will be well.&#160; If you force your way into that
cottage, all is over between us.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There was such earnestness,
such despair, in her manner that her words arrested
me, and I stood irresolute before the door.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I will trust you on
one condition, and on one condition only,&#8217; said
I at last.&#160; &#8217;It is that this mystery comes
to an end from now.&#160; You are at liberty to preserve
your secret, but you must promise me that there shall
be no more nightly visits, no more doings which are
kept from my knowledge.&#160; I am willing to forget
those which are passed if you will promise that there
shall be no more in the future.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I was sure that you
would trust me,&#8217; she cried, with a great sigh
of relief.&#160; &#8217;It shall be just as you wish.&#160;
Come away&#8212;&#173;oh, come away up to the house.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Still pulling at my sleeve,
she led me away from the cottage.&#160; As we went
I glanced back, and there was that yellow livid face
watching us out of the upper window.&#160; What link
could there be between that creature and my wife?&#160;
Or how could the coarse, rough woman whom I had seen
the day before be connected with her?&#160; It was
a strange puzzle, and yet I knew that my mind could
never know ease again until I had solved it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;For two days after this I stayed
at home, and my wife appeared to abide loyally by
our engagement, for, as far as I know, she never stirred
out of the house.&#160; On the third day, however,
I had ample evidence that her solemn promise was not
enough to hold her back from this secret influence
which drew her away from her husband and her duty.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I had gone into town on that
day, but I returned by the 2.40 instead of the 3.36,
which is my usual train.&#160; As I entered the house
the maid ran into the hall with a startled face.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where is your mistress?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I think that she has gone out for a
walk,&#8217; she answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My mind was instantly filled
with suspicion.&#160; I rushed upstairs to make sure
that she was not in the house.&#160; As I did so I happened
to glance out of one of the upper windows, and saw
the maid with whom I had just been speaking running
across the field in the direction of the cottage.&#160;
Then of course I saw exactly what it all meant.&#160;
My wife had gone over there, and had asked the servant
to call her if I should return.&#160; Tingling with
anger, I rushed down and hurried across, determined
to end the matter once and forever.&#160; I saw my
wife and the maid hurrying back along the lane, but
I did not stop to speak with them.&#160; In the cottage
lay the secret which was casting a shadow over my
life.&#160; I vowed that, come what might, it should
be a secret no longer.&#160; I did not even knock when
I reached it, but turned the handle and rushed into
the passage.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was all still and quiet
upon the ground floor.&#160; In the kitchen a kettle
was singing on the fire, and a large black cat lay
coiled up in the basket; but there was no sign of
the woman whom I had seen before.&#160; I ran into
the other room, but it was equally deserted.&#160; Then
I rushed up the stairs, only to find two other rooms
empty and deserted at the top.&#160; There was no one
at all in the whole house.&#160; The furniture and pictures
were of the most common and vulgar description, save
in the one chamber at the window of which I had seen
the strange face.&#160; That was comfortable and elegant,
and all my suspicions rose into a fierce bitter flame
when I saw that on the mantelpiece stood a copy of
a full-length photograph of my wife, which had been
taken at my request only three months ago.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I stayed long enough to make
certain that the house was absolutely empty.&#160;
Then I left it, feeling a weight at my heart such as
I had never had before.&#160; My wife came out into
the hall as I entered my house; but I was too hurt
and angry to speak with her, and pushing past her,
I made my way into my study.&#160; She followed me,
however, before I could close the door.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I am sorry that I broke
my promise, Jack,&#8217; said she; &#8217;but if you
knew all the circumstances I am sure that you would
forgive me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tell me everything, then,&#8217; said
I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I cannot, Jack, I cannot,&#8217; she
cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Until you tell me who
it is that has been living in that cottage, and who
it is to whom you have given that photograph, there
can never be any confidence between us,&#8217; said
I, and breaking away from her, I left the house.&#160;
That was yesterday, Mr. Holmes, and I have not seen
her since, nor do I know anything more about this
strange business.&#160; It is the first shadow that
has come between us, and it has so shaken me that I
do not know what I should do for the best.&#160; Suddenly
this morning it occurred to me that you were the man
to advise me, so I have hurried to you now, and I
place myself unreservedly in your hands.&#160; If there
is any point which I have not made clear, pray question
me about it.&#160; But, above all, tell me quickly
what I am to do, for this misery is more than I can
bear.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes and I had listened with the
utmost interest to this extraordinary statement, which
had been delivered in the jerky, broken fashion of
a man who is under the influence of extreme emotions.&#160;
My companion sat silent for some time, with his chin
upon his hand, lost in thought.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said he at
last, &#8220;could you swear that this was a man&#8217;s
face which you saw at the window?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Each time that I saw it I was
some distance away from it, so that it is impossible
for me to say.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You appear, however, to have
been disagreeably impressed by it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It seemed to be of an unnatural
color, and to have a strange rigidity about the features.&#160;
When I approached, it vanished with a jerk.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How long is it since your wife
asked you for a hundred pounds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly two months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen a photograph of her first
husband?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No; there was a great fire
at Atlanta very shortly after his death, and all her
papers were destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet she had a certificate of death.&#160;
You say that you saw it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; she got a duplicate after the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever meet any one who knew her in America?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or get letters from it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Thank you.&#160; I should like
to think over the matter a little now.&#160; If the
cottage is now permanently deserted we may have some
difficulty.&#160; If, on the other hand, as I fancy
is more likely, the inmates were warned of your coming,
and left before you entered yesterday, then they may
be back now, and we should clear it all up easily.&#160;
Let me advise you, then, to return to Norbury, and
to examine the windows of the cottage again.&#160;
If you have reason to believe that it is inhabited,
do not force your way in, but send a wire to my friend
and me.&#160; We shall be with you within an hour of
receiving it, and we shall then very soon get to the
bottom of the business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if it is still empty?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In that case I shall come out
to-morrow and talk it over with you.&#160; Good-by;
and, above all, do not fret until you know that you
really have a cause for it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am afraid that this is a
bad business, Watson,&#8221; said my companion, as
he returned after accompanying Mr. Grant Munro to the
door.&#160; &#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It had an ugly sound,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#160; There&#8217;s blackmail in it, or
I am much mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who is the blackmailer?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, it must be the creature
who lives in the only comfortable room in the place,
and has her photograph above his fireplace.&#160; Upon
my word, Watson, there is something very attractive
about that livid face at the window, and I would not
have missed the case for worlds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a theory?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, a provisional one.&#160;
But I shall be surprised if it does not turn out to
be correct.&#160; This woman&#8217;s first husband is
in that cottage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How else can we explain her
frenzied anxiety that her second one should not enter
it?&#160; The facts, as I read them, are something like
this:&#160; This woman was married in America.&#160;
Her husband developed some hateful qualities; or shall
we say that he contracted some loathsome disease,
and became a leper or an imbecile?&#160; She flies from
him at last, returns to England, changes her name,
and starts her life, as she thinks, afresh.&#160; She
has been married three years, and believes that her
position is quite secure, having shown her husband
the death certificate of some man whose name she has
assumed, when suddenly her whereabouts is discovered
by her first husband; or, we may suppose, by some
unscrupulous woman who has attached herself to the
invalid.&#160; They write to the wife, and threaten
to come and expose her.&#160; She asks for a hundred
pounds, and endeavors to buy them off.&#160; They come
in spite of it, and when the husband mentions casually
to the wife that there are new-comers in the cottage,
she knows in some way that they are her pursuers.&#160;
She waits until her husband is asleep, and then she
rushes down to endeavor to persuade them to leave
her in peace.&#160; Having no success, she goes again
next morning, and her husband meets her, as he has
told us, as she comes out.&#160; She promises him then
not to go there again, but two days afterwards the
hope of getting rid of those dreadful neighbors was
too strong for her, and she made another attempt,
taking down with her the photograph which had probably
been demanded from her.&#160; In the midst of this
interview the maid rushed in to say that the master
had come home, on which the wife, knowing that he
would come straight down to the cottage, hurried the
inmates out at the back door, into the grove of fir-trees,
probably, which was mentioned as standing near.&#160;
In this way he found the place deserted.&#160; I shall
be very much surprised, however, if it is still so
when he reconnoitres it this evening.&#160; What do
you think of my theory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all surmise.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But at least it covers all
the facts.&#160; When new facts come to our knowledge
which cannot be covered by it, it will be time enough
to reconsider it.&#160; We can do nothing more until
we have a message from our friend at Norbury.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">But we had not a very long time to
wait for that.&#160; It came just as we had finished
our tea.&#160; &#8220;The cottage is still tenanted,&#8221;
it said.&#160; &#8220;Have seen the face again at the
window.&#160; Will meet the seven o&#8217;clock train,
and will take no steps until you arrive.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He was waiting on the platform when
we stepped out, and we could see in the light of the
station lamps that he was very pale, and quivering
with agitation.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They are still there, Mr. Holmes,&#8221;
said he, laying his hand hard upon my friend&#8217;s
sleeve.&#160; &#8220;I saw lights in the cottage as
I came down.&#160; We shall settle it now once and
for all.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What is your plan, then?&#8221;
asked Holmes, as he walked down the dark tree-lined
road.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am going to force my way
in and see for myself who is in the house.&#160; I
wish you both to be there as witnesses.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are quite determined to
do this, in spite of your wife&#8217;s warning that
it is better that you should not solve the mystery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am determined.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, I think that you are
in the right.&#160; Any truth is better than indefinite
doubt.&#160; We had better go up at once.&#160; Of course,
legally, we are putting ourselves hopelessly in the
wrong; but I think that it is worth it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It was a very dark night, and a thin
rain began to fall as we turned from the high road
into a narrow lane, deeply rutted, with hedges on
either side.&#160; Mr. Grant Munro pushed impatiently
forward, however, and we stumbled after him as best
we could.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There are the lights of my
house,&#8221; he murmured, pointing to a glimmer among
the trees.&#160; &#8220;And here is the cottage which
I am going to enter.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We turned a corner in the lane as
he spoke, and there was the building close beside
us.&#160; A yellow bar falling across the black foreground
showed that the door was not quite closed, and one
window in the upper story was brightly illuminated.&#160;
As we looked, we saw a dark blur moving across the
blind.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is that creature!&#8221;
cried Grant Munro.&#160; &#8220;You can see for yourselves
that some one is there.&#160; Now follow me, and we
shall soon know all.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We approached the door; but suddenly
a woman appeared out of the shadow and stood in the
golden track of the lamp-light.&#160; I could not see
her face in the darkness, but her arms were thrown
out in an attitude of entreaty.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t
Jack!&#8221; she cried.&#160; &#8220;I had a presentiment
that you would come this evening.&#160; Think better
of it, dear!&#160; Trust me again, and you will never
have cause to regret it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have trusted you too long,
Effie,&#8221; he cried, sternly.&#160; &#8220;Leave
go of me!&#160; I must pass you.&#160; My friends and
I are going to settle this matter once and forever!&#8221;
He pushed her to one side, and we followed closely
after him.&#160; As he threw the door open an old woman
ran out in front of him and tried to bar his passage,
but he thrust her back, and an instant afterwards
we were all upon the stairs.&#160; Grant Munro rushed
into the lighted room at the top, and we entered at
his heels.</p>

<p align="justify">It was a cosey, well-furnished apartment,
with two candles burning upon the table and two upon
the mantelpiece.&#160; In the corner, stooping over
a desk, there sat what appeared to be a little girl.&#160;
Her face was turned away as we entered, but we could
see that she was dressed in a red frock, and that
she had long white gloves on.&#160; As she whisked round
to us, I gave a cry of surprise and horror.&#160; The
face which she turned towards us was of the strangest
livid tint, and the features were absolutely devoid
of any expression.&#160; An instant later the mystery
was explained.&#160; Holmes, with a laugh, passed his
hand behind the child&#8217;s ear, a mask peeled off
from her countenance, and there was a little coal
black negress, with all her white teeth flashing in
amusement at our amazed faces.&#160; I burst out laughing,
out of sympathy with her merriment; but Grant Munro
stood staring, with his hand clutching his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he cried.&#160; &#8220;What can
be the meaning of this?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will tell you the meaning
of it,&#8221; cried the lady, sweeping into the room
with a proud, set face.&#160; &#8220;You have forced
me, against my own judgment, to tell you, and now
we must both make the best of it.&#160; My husband
died at Atlanta.&#160; My child survived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your child?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She drew a large silver locket from
her bosom.&#160; &#8220;You have never seen this open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understood that it did not open.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">She touched a spring, and the front
hinged back.&#160; There was a portrait within of a
man strikingly handsome and intelligent-looking, but
bearing unmistakable signs upon his features of his
African descent.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is John Hebron, of Atlanta,&#8221;
said the lady, &#8220;and a nobler man never walked
the earth.&#160; I cut myself off from my race in order
to wed him, but never once while he lived did I for
an instant regret it.&#160; It was our misfortune that
our only child took after his people rather than mine.&#160;
It is often so in such matches, and little Lucy is
darker far than ever her father was.&#160; But dark
or fair, she is my own dear little girlie, and her
mother&#8217;s pet.&#8221;&#160; The little creature
ran across at the words and nestled up against the
lady&#8217;s dress.&#160; &#8220;When I left her in
America,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;it was only
because her health was weak, and the change might
have done her harm.&#160; She was given to the care
of a faithful Scotch woman who had once been our servant.&#160;
Never for an instant did I dream of disowning her
as my child.&#160; But when chance threw you in my way,
Jack, and I learned to love you, I feared to tell
you about my child.&#160; God forgive me, I feared
that I should lose you, and I had not the courage
to tell you.&#160; I had to choose between you, and
in my weakness I turned away from my own little girl.&#160;
For three years I have kept her existence a secret
from you, but I heard from the nurse, and I knew that
all was well with her.&#160; At last, however, there
came an overwhelming desire to see the child once
more.&#160; I struggled against it, but in vain.&#160;
Though I knew the danger, I determined to have the
child over, if it were but for a few weeks.&#160; I
sent a hundred pounds to the nurse, and I gave her
instructions about this cottage, so that she might
come as a neighbor, without my appearing to be in
any way connected with her.&#160; I pushed my precautions
so far as to order her to keep the child in the house
during the daytime, and to cover up her little face
and hands so that even those who might see her at
the window should not gossip about there being a black
child in the neighborhood.&#160; If I had been less
cautious I might have been more wise, but I was half
crazy with fear that you should learn the truth.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was you who told me first
that the cottage was occupied.&#160; I should have
waited for the morning, but I could not sleep for excitement,
and so at last I slipped out, knowing how difficult
it is to awake you.&#160; But you saw me go, and that
was the beginning of my troubles.&#160; Next day you
had my secret at your mercy, but you nobly refrained
from pursuing your advantage.&#160; Three days later,
however, the nurse and child only just escaped from
the back door as you rushed in at the front one.&#160;
And now to-night you at last know all, and I ask you
what is to become of us, my child and me?&#8221; She
clasped her hands and waited for an answer.</p>

<p align="justify">It was a long ten minutes before Grant
Munro broke the silence, and when his answer came
it was one of which I love to think.&#160; He lifted
the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying
her, he held his other hand out to his wife and turned
towards the door.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We can talk it over more comfortably
at home,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;I am not a very
good man, Effie, but I think that I am a better one
than you have given me credit for being.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes and I followed them down the
lane, and my friend plucked at my sleeve as we came
out.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I think,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that
we shall be of more use in London than in Norbury.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Not another word did he say of the
case until late that night, when he was turning away,
with his lighted candle, for his bedroom.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Watson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if
it should ever strike you that I am getting a little
over-confident in my powers, or giving less pains to
a case than it deserves, kindly whisper &#8216;Norbury&#8217;
in my ear, and I shall be infinitely obliged to you.&#8221;</p>

<mbp:pagebreak />
<h1>Adventure III.&#160; The Stock-Broker&#8217;s Clerk</h1>

<p align="justify">Shortly after my marriage I had bought
a connection in the Paddington district.&#160; Old
Mr. Farquhar, from whom I purchased it, had at one
time an excellent general practice; but his age, and
an affliction of the nature of St. Vitus&#8217;s dance
from which he suffered, had very much thinned it.&#160;
The public not unnaturally goes on the principle that
he who would heal others must himself be whole, and
looks askance at the curative powers of the man whose
own case is beyond the reach of his drugs.&#160; Thus
as my predecessor weakened his practice declined,
until when I purchased it from him it had sunk from
twelve hundred to little more than three hundred a
year.&#160; I had confidence, however, in my own youth
and energy, and was convinced that in a very few years
the concern would be as flourishing as ever.</p>

<p align="justify">For three months after taking over
the practice I was kept very closely at work, and
saw little of my friend Sherlock Holmes, for I was
too busy to visit Baker Street, and he seldom went
anywhere himself save upon professional business.&#160;
I was surprised, therefore, when, one morning in June,
as I sat reading the British Medical Journal after
breakfast, I heard a ring at the bell, followed by
the high, somewhat strident tones of my old companion&#8217;s
voice.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, my dear Watson,&#8221;
said he, striding into the room, &#8220;I am very
delighted to see you!&#160; I trust that Mrs. Watson
has entirely recovered from all the little excitements
connected with our adventure of the Sign of Four.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Thank you, we are both very
well,&#8221; said I, shaking him warmly by the hand.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And I hope, also,&#8221; he
continued, sitting down in the rocking-chair, &#8220;that
the cares of medical practice have not entirely obliterated
the interest which you used to take in our little
deductive problems.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;it was only last night that I was looking over
my old notes, and classifying some of our past results.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust that you don&#8217;t consider your
collection closed.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not at all.&#160; I should wish
nothing better than to have some more of such experiences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day, for example?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to-day, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And as far off as Birmingham?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, if you wish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the practice?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do my neighbor&#8217;s when
he goes.&#160; He is always ready to work off the debt.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ha!&#160; Nothing could be better,&#8221;
said Holmes, leaning back in his chair and looking
keenly at me from under his half closed lids.&#160;
&#8220;I perceive that you have been unwell lately.&#160;
Summer colds are always a little trying.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I was confined to the house
by a severe chill for three days last week.&#160; I
thought, however, that I had cast off every trace of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have.&#160; You look remarkably robust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How, then, did you know of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, you know my methods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You deduced it, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And from what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From your slippers.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I glanced down at the new patent leathers
which I was wearing.&#160; &#8220;How on earth&#8212;&#173;&#8221;
I began, but Holmes answered my question before it
was asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your slippers are new,&#8221;
he said.&#160; &#8220;You could not have had them more
than a few weeks.&#160; The soles which you are at
this moment presenting to me are slightly scorched.&#160;
For a moment I thought they might have got wet and
been burned in the drying.&#160; But near the instep
there is a small circular wafer of paper with the
shopman&#8217;s hieroglyphics upon it.&#160; Damp would
of course have removed this.&#160; You had, then, been
sitting with your feet outstretched to the fire, which
a man would hardly do even in so wet a June as this
if he were in his full health.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Like all Holmes&#8217;s reasoning
the thing seemed simplicity itself when it was once
explained.&#160; He read the thought upon my features,
and his smile had a tinge of bitterness.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am afraid that I rather give
myself away when I explain,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;Results
without causes are much more impressive.&#160; You are
ready to come to Birmingham, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#160; What is the case?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You shall hear it all in the
train.&#160; My client is outside in a four-wheeler.&#160;
Can you come at once?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In an instant.&#8221;&#160;
I scribbled a note to my neighbor, rushed upstairs
to explain the matter to my wife, and joined Holmes
upon the door-step.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your neighbor is a doctor,&#8221;
said he, nodding at the brass plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he bought a practice as I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An old-established one?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Just the same as mine.&#160;
Both have been ever since the houses were built.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#160; Then you got hold of the best of the
two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I did.&#160; But how do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By the steps, my boy.&#160;
Yours are worn three inches deeper than his.&#160; But
this gentleman in the cab is my client, Mr. Hall Pycroft.&#160;
Allow me to introduce you to him.&#160; Whip your horse
up, cabby, for we have only just time to catch our
train.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The man whom I found myself facing
was a well built, fresh-complexioned young fellow,
with a frank, honest face and a slight, crisp, yellow
mustache.&#160; He wore a very shiny top hat and a neat
suit of sober black, which made him look what he was&#8212;&#173;a
smart young City man, of the class who have been labeled
cockneys, but who give us our crack volunteer regiments,
and who turn out more fine athletes and sportsmen than
any body of men in these islands.&#160; His round,
ruddy face was naturally full of cheeriness, but the
corners of his mouth seemed to me to be pulled down
in a half-comical distress.&#160; It was not, however,
until we were all in a first-class carriage and well
started upon our journey to Birmingham that I was
able to learn what the trouble was which had driven
him to Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We have a clear run here of
seventy minutes,&#8221; Holmes remarked.&#160; &#8220;I
want you, Mr. Hall Pycroft, to tell my friend your
very interesting experience exactly as you have told
it to me, or with more detail if possible.&#160; It
will be of use to me to hear the succession of events
again.&#160; It is a case, Watson, which may prove to
have something in it, or may prove to have nothing,
but which, at least, presents those unusual and outr&#233;
features which are as dear to you as they are to me.&#160;
Now, Mr. Pycroft, I shall not interrupt you again.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Our young companion looked at me with
a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The worst of the story is,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;that I show myself up as such a confounded
fool.&#160; Of course it may work out all right, and
I don&#8217;t see that I could have done otherwise;
but if I have lost my crib and get nothing in exchange
I shall feel what a soft Johnnie I have been.&#160;
I&#8217;m not very good at telling a story, Dr. Watson,
but it is like this with me:&#160;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I used to have a billet at
Coxon &#38; Woodhouse&#8217;s, of Draper&#8217;s Gardens,
but they were let in early in the spring through the
Venezuelan loan, as no doubt you remember, and came
a nasty cropper.&#160; I had been with them five years,
and old Coxon gave me a ripping good testimonial when
the smash came, but of course we clerks were all turned
adrift, the twenty-seven of us.&#160; I tried here
and tried there, but there were lots of other chaps
on the same lay as myself, and it was a perfect frost
for a long time.&#160; I had been taking three pounds
a week at Coxon&#8217;s, and I had saved about seventy
of them, but I soon worked my way through that and
out at the other end.&#160; I was fairly at the end
of my tether at last, and could hardly find the stamps
to answer the advertisements or the envelopes to stick
them to.&#160; I had worn out my boots paddling up office
stairs, and I seemed just as far from getting a billet
as ever.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;At last I saw a vacancy at
Mawson &#38; Williams&#8217;s, the great <i>stock</i>-<i>broking</i>
firm in Lombard Street.&#160; I dare say E. C. Is not
much in your line, but I can tell you that this is
about the richest house in London.&#160; The advertisement
was to be answered by letter only.&#160; I sent in my
testimonial and application, but without the least
hope of getting it.&#160; Back came an answer by return,
saying that if I would appear next Monday I might
take over my new duties at once, provided that my appearance
was satisfactory.&#160; No one knows how these things
are worked.&#160; Some people say that the manager
just plunges his hand into the heap and takes the first
that comes.&#160; Anyhow it was my innings that time,
and I don&#8217;t ever wish to feel better pleased.&#160;
The screw was a pound a week rise, and the duties
just about the same as at Coxon&#8217;s.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And now I come to the queer
part of the business.&#160; I was in diggings out Hampstead
way, 17 Potter&#8217;s Terrace.&#160; Well, I was sitting
doing a smoke that very evening after I had been promised
the appointment, when up came my landlady with a card
which had &#8216;Arthur Pinner, Financial Agent,&#8217;
printed upon it.&#160; I had never heard the name before
and could not imagine what he wanted with me; but,
of course, I asked her to show him up.&#160; In he
walked, a middle-sized, dark-haired, dark-eyed, black-bearded
man, with a touch of the Sheeny about his nose.&#160;
He had a brisk kind of way with him and spoke sharply,
like a man who knew the value of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Hall Pycroft, I believe?&#8217;&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, sir,&#8217; I answered, pushing
a chair towards him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Lately engaged at Coxon &#38; Woodhouse&#8217;s?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And now on the staff of Mawson&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Quite so.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; said he,
&#8217;the fact is that I have heard some really extraordinary
stories about your financial ability.&#160; You remember
Parker, who used to be Coxon&#8217;s manager?&#160;
He can never say enough about it.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Of course I was pleased to
hear this.&#160; I had always been pretty sharp in
the office, but I had never dreamed that I was talked
about in the City in this fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You have a good memory?&#8217; said
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pretty fair,&#8217; I answered, modestly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Have you kept in touch
with the market while you have been out of work?&#8217;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes.&#160; I read the stock exchange
list every morning.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Now that shows real
application!&#8217; he cried.&#160; &#8217;That is the
way to prosper!&#160; You won&#8217;t mind my testing
you, will you?&#160; Let me see.&#160; How are Ayrshires?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;A hundred and six and
a quarter to a hundred and five and seven-eighths.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And New Zealand consolidated?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;A hundred and four.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And British Broken Hills?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Seven to seven-and-six.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Wonderful!&#8217; he
cried, with his hands up.&#160; &#8217;This quite fits
in with all that I had heard.&#160; My boy, my boy,
you are very much too good to be a clerk at Mawson&#8217;s!&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This outburst rather astonished
me, as you can think.&#160; &#8216;Well,&#8217; said
I, &#8217;other people don&#8217;t think quite so
much of me as you seem to do, Mr. Pinner.&#160; I had
a hard enough fight to get this berth, and I am very
glad to have it.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Pooh, man; you should
soar above it.&#160; You are not in your true sphere.&#160;
Now, I&#8217;ll tell you how it stands with me.&#160;
What I have to offer is little enough when measured
by your ability, but when compared with Mawson&#8217;s,
it&#8217;s light to dark.&#160; Let me see.&#160; When
do you go to Mawson&#8217;s?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;On Monday.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Ha, ha!&#160; I think
I would risk a little sporting flutter that you don&#8217;t
go there at all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not go to Mawson&#8217;s?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;No, sir.&#160; By that
day you will be the business manager of the Franco-Midland
Hardware Company, Limited, with a hundred and thirty-four
branches in the towns and villages of France, not counting
one in Brussels and one in San Remo.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This took my breath away.&#160; &#8216;I never
heard of it,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;V&#233;ry likely not.&#160;
It has been kept very quiet, for the capital was all
privately subscribed, and it&#8217;s too good a thing
to let the public into.&#160; My brother, Harry Pinner,
is promoter, and joins the board after allotment as
managing director.&#160; He knew I was in the swim down
here, and asked me to pick up a good man cheap.&#160;
A young, pushing man with plenty of snap about him.&#160;
Parker spoke of you, and that brought me here to-night.&#160;
We can only offer you a beggarly five hundred to start
with.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Five hundred a year!&#8217; I shouted.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Only that at the beginning;
but you are to have an overriding commission of one
per cent on all business done by your agents, and you
may take my word for it that this will come to more
than your salary.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But I know nothing about hardware.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tut, my boy; you know about figures.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My head buzzed, and I could
hardly sit still in my chair.&#160; But suddenly a
little chill of doubt came upon me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I must be frank with
you,&#8217; said I.&#160; &#8217;Mawson only gives me
two hundred, but Mawson is safe.&#160; Now, really,
I know so little about your company that&#8212;&#173;&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Ah, smart, smart!&#8217;
he cried, in a kind of ecstasy of delight.&#160; &#8217;You
are the very man for us.&#160; You are not to be talked
over, and quite right, too.&#160; Now, here&#8217;s
a note for a hundred pounds, and if you think that
we can do business you may just slip it into your
pocket as an advance upon your salary.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;That is very handsome,&#8217;
said I.&#160; &#8217;When should I take over my new
duties?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Be in Birmingham to-morrow
at one,&#8217; said he.&#160; &#8217;I have a note in
my pocket here which you will take to my brother.&#160;
You will find him at 126b Corporation Street, where
the temporary offices of the company are situated.&#160;
Of course he must confirm your engagement, but between
ourselves it will be all right.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Really, I hardly know
how to express my gratitude, Mr. Pinner,&#8217; said
I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Not at all, my boy.&#160;
You have only got your deserts.&#160; There are one
or two small things&#8212;&#173;mere formalities&#8212;&#173;which
I must arrange with you.&#160; You have a bit of paper
beside you there.&#160; Kindly write upon it &#8220;I
am perfectly willing to act as business manager to
the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited, at a
minimum salary of L500."&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did as he asked, and he put the paper in
his pocket.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;There is one other detail,&#8217;
said he.&#160; &#8217;What do you intend to do about
Mawson&#8217;s?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I had forgotten all about Mawson&#8217;s
in my joy.&#160; &#8216;I&#8217;ll write and resign,&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Precisely what I don&#8217;t
want you to do.&#160; I had a row over you with Mawson&#8217;s
manager.&#160; I had gone up to ask him about you, and
he was very offensive; accused me of coaxing you away
from the service of the firm, and that sort of thing.&#160;
At last I fairly lost my temper.&#160; &#8220;If you
want good men you should pay them a good price,&#8221;
said I.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;He would rather have
our small price than your big one,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll lay you a
fiver,&#8217; said I, &#8217;that when he has my offer
you&#8217;ll never so much as hear from him again.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Done!&#8217; said he.&#160;
&#8217;We picked him out of the gutter, and he won&#8217;t
leave us so easily.&#8217;&#160; Those were his very
words.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;The impudent scoundrel!&#8217;
I cried.&#160; &#8217;I&#8217;ve never so much as seen
him in my life.&#160; Why should I consider him in
any way?&#160; I shall certainly not write if you would
rather I didn&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Good!&#160; That&#8217;s
a promise,&#8217; said he, rising from his chair.&#160;
&#8217;Well, I&#8217;m delighted to have got so good
a man for my brother.&#160; Here&#8217;s your advance
of a hundred pounds, and here is the letter.&#160; Make
a note of the address, 126b Corporation Street, and
remember that one o&#8217;clock to-morrow is your
appointment.&#160; Good-night; and may you have all
the fortune that you deserve!&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That&#8217;s just about all
that passed between us, as near as I can remember.&#160;
You can imagine, Dr. Watson, how pleased I was at such
an extraordinary bit of good fortune.&#160; I sat up
half the night hugging myself over it, and next day
I was off to Birmingham in a train that would take
me in plenty time for my appointment.&#160; I took my
things to a hotel in New Street, and then I made my
way to the address which had been given me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was a quarter of an hour
before my time, but I thought that would make no difference.
126b was a passage between two large shops, which
led to a winding stone stair, from which there were
many flats, let as offices to companies or professional
men.&#160; The names of the occupants were painted
at the bottom on the wall, but there was no such name
as the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited.&#160;
I stood for a few minutes with my heart in my boots,
wondering whether the whole thing was an elaborate
hoax or not, when up came a man and addressed me.&#160;
He was very like the chap I had seen the night before,
the same figure and voice, but he was clean shaven
and his hair was lighter.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Are you Mr. Hall Pycroft?&#8217; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Oh!&#160; I was expecting
you, but you are a trifle before your time.&#160; I
had a note from my brother this morning in which he
sang your praises very loudly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;I was just looking for the offices when
you came.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;We have not got our
name up yet, for we only secured these temporary premises
last week.&#160; Come up with me, and we will talk the
matter over.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I followed him to the top of
a very lofty stair, and there, right under the slates,
were a couple of empty, dusty little rooms, uncarpeted
and uncurtained, into which he led me.&#160; I had
thought of a great office with shining tables and
rows of clerks, such as I was used to, and I dare say
I stared rather straight at the two deal chairs and
one little table, which, with a ledger and a waste
paper basket, made up the whole furniture.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t be disheartened,
Mr. Pycroft,&#8217; said my new acquaintance, seeing
the length of my face.&#160; &#8217;Rome was not built
in a day, and we have lots of money at our backs,
though we don&#8217;t cut much dash yet in offices.&#160;
Pray sit down, and let me have your letter.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave it to him, and he read it over very
carefully.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You seem to have made
a vast impression upon my brother Arthur,&#8217; said
he; &#8217;and I know that he is a pretty shrewd judge.&#160;
He swears by London, you know; and I by Birmingham;
but this time I shall follow his advice.&#160; Pray
consider yourself definitely engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What are my duties?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;You will eventually
manage the great depot in Paris, which will pour a
flood of English crockery into the shops of a hundred
and thirty-four agents in France.&#160; The purchase
will be completed in a week, and meanwhile you will
remain in Birmingham and make yourself useful.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;For answer, he took a big red book out of a
drawer.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;This is a directory
of Paris,&#8217; said he, &#8217;with the trades after
the names of the people.&#160; I want you to take it
home with you, and to mark off all the hardware sellers,
with their addresses.&#160; It would be of the greatest
use to me to have them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Surely there are classified lists?&#8217;
I suggested.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Not reliable ones.&#160;
Their system is different from ours.&#160; Stick at
it, and let me have the lists by Monday, at twelve.&#160;
Good-day, Mr. Pycroft.&#160; If you continue to show
zeal and intelligence you will find the company a
good master.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I went back to the hotel with
the big book under my arm, and with very conflicting
feelings in my breast.&#160; On the one hand, I was
definitely engaged and had a hundred pounds in my
pocket; on the other, the look of the offices, the
absence of name on the wall, and other of the points
which would strike a business man had left a bad impression
as to the position of my employers.&#160; However,
come what might, I had my money, so I settled down
to my task.&#160; All Sunday I was kept hard at work,
and yet by Monday I had only got as far as H. I went
round to my employer, found him in the same dismantled
kind of room, and was told to keep at it until Wednesday,
and then come again.&#160; On Wednesday it was still
unfinished, so I hammered away until Friday&#8212;&#173;that
is, yesterday.&#160; Then I brought it round to Mr.
Harry Pinner.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Thank you very much,&#8217;
said he; &#8217;I fear that I underrated the difficulty
of the task.&#160; This list will be of very material
assistance to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It took some time,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;And now,&#8217; said
he, &#8217;I want you to make a list of the furniture
shops, for they all sell crockery.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;V&#233;ry good.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;And you can come up
to-morrow evening, at seven, and let me know how you
are getting on.&#160; Don&#8217;t overwork yourself.&#160;
A couple of hours at Day&#8217;s Music Hall in the
evening would do you no harm after your labors.&#8217;&#160;
He laughed as he spoke, and I saw with a thrill that
his second tooth upon the left-hand side had been
very badly stuffed with gold.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Sherlock Holmes rubbed his hands with
delight, and I stared with astonishment at our client.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You may well look surprised,
Dr. Watson; but it is this way,&#8221; said he:&#160;
&#8220;When I was speaking to the other chap in London,
at the time that he laughed at my not going to Mawson&#8217;s,
I happened to notice that his tooth was stuffed in
this very identical fashion.&#160; The glint of the
gold in each case caught my eye, you see.&#160; When
I put that with the voice and figure being the same,
and only those things altered which might be changed
by a razor or a wig, I could not doubt that it was
the same man.&#160; Of course you expect two brothers
to be alike, but not that they should have the same
tooth stuffed in the same way.&#160; He bowed me out,
and I found myself in the street, hardly knowing whether
I was on my head or my heels.&#160; Back I went to
my hotel, put my head in a basin of cold water, and
tried to think it out.&#160; Why had he sent me from
London to Birmingham?&#160; Why had he got there before
me?&#160; And why had he written a letter from himself
to himself?&#160; It was altogether too much for me,
and I could make no sense of it.&#160; And then suddenly
it struck me that what was dark to me might be very
light to Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&#160; I had just time
to get up to town by the night train to see him this
morning, and to bring you both back with me to Birmingham.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">There was a pause after the stock-broker&#8217;s
clerk had concluded his surprising experience.&#160;
Then Sherlock Holmes cocked his eye at me, leaning
back on the cushions with a pleased and yet critical
face, like a connoisseur who has just taken his first
sip of a comet vintage.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Rather fine, Watson, is it
not?&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;There are points in
it which please me.&#160; I think that you will agree
with me that an interview with Mr. Arthur Harry Pinner
in the temporary offices of the Franco-Midland Hardware
Company, Limited, would be a rather interesting experience
for both of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can we do it?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, easily enough,&#8221; said
Hall Pycroft, cheerily.&#160; &#8220;You are two friends
of mine who are in want of a billet, and what could
be more natural than that I should bring you both
round to the managing director?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Quite so, of course,&#8221;
said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;I should like to have a look
at the gentleman, and see if I can make anything of
his little game.&#160; What qualities have you, my
friend, which would make your services so valuable?
or is it possible that&#8212;&#173;&#8221; He began
biting his nails and staring blankly out of the window,
and we hardly drew another word from him until we
were in New Street.</p>

<p align="justify">At seven o&#8217;clock that evening
we were walking, the three of us, down Corporation
Street to the company&#8217;s offices.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is no use our being at all
before our time,&#8221; said our client.&#160; &#8220;He
only comes there to see me, apparently, for the place
is deserted up to the very hour he names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is suggestive,&#8221; remarked Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By Jove, I told you so!&#8221;
cried the clerk.&#160; &#8220;That&#8217;s he walking
ahead of us there.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He pointed to a smallish, dark, well-dressed
man who was bustling along the other side of the road.&#160;
As we watched him he looked across at a boy who was
bawling out the latest edition of the evening paper,
and running over among the cabs and busses, he bought
one from him.&#160; Then, clutching it in his hand,
he vanished through a door-way.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There he goes!&#8221; cried
Hall Pycroft.&#160; &#8220;These are the company&#8217;s
offices into which he has gone.&#160; Come with me,
and I&#8217;ll fix it up as easily as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Following his lead, we ascended five
stories, until we found ourselves outside a half-opened
door, at which our client tapped.&#160; A voice within
bade us enter, and we entered a bare, unfurnished room
such as Hall Pycroft had described.&#160; At the single
table sat the man whom we had seen in the street,
with his evening paper spread out in front of him,
and as he looked up at us it seemed to me that I had
never looked upon a face which bore such marks of
grief, and of something beyond grief&#8212;&#173;of
a horror such as comes to few men in a lifetime.&#160;
His brow glistened with perspiration, his cheeks were
of the dull, dead white of a fish&#8217;s belly, and
his eyes were wild and staring.&#160; He looked at his
clerk as though he failed to recognize him, and I
could see by the astonishment depicted upon our conductor&#8217;s
face that this was by no means the usual appearance
of his employer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look ill, Mr. Pinner!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, I am not very well,&#8221;
answered the other, making obvious efforts to pull
himself together, and licking his dry lips before he
spoke.&#160; &#8220;Who are these gentlemen whom you
have brought with you?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;One is Mr. Harris, of Bermondsey,
and the other is Mr. Price, of this town,&#8221; said
our clerk, glibly.&#160; &#8220;They are friends of
mine and gentlemen of experience, but they have been
out of a place for some little time, and they hoped
that perhaps you might find an opening for them in
the company&#8217;s employment.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;V&#233;ry possibly!&#160; V&#233;ry possibly!&#8221;
cried Mr. Pinner with a ghastly smile.&#160; &#8220;Yes,
I have no doubt that we shall be able to do something
for you.&#160; What is your particular line, Mr. Harris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an accountant,&#8221; said Holmes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah yes, we shall want something of the sort.&#160;
And you, Mr. Price?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A clerk,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have every hope that the
company may accommodate you.&#160; I will let you know
about it as soon as we come to any conclusion.&#160;
And now I beg that you will go.&#160; For God&#8217;s
sake leave me to myself!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">These last words were shot out of
him, as though the constraint which he was evidently
setting upon himself had suddenly and utterly burst
asunder.&#160; Holmes and I glanced at each other, and
Hall Pycroft took a step towards the table.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You forget, Mr. Pinner, that
I am here by appointment to receive some directions
from you,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Pycroft, certainly,&#8221;
the other resumed in a calmer tone.&#160; &#8220;You
may wait here a moment; and there is no reason why
your friends should not wait with you.&#160; I will
be entirely at your service in three minutes, if I
might trespass upon your patience so far.&#8221;&#160;
He rose with a very courteous air, and, bowing to
us, he passed out through a door at the farther end
of the room, which he closed behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now?&#8221; whispered Holmes.&#160; &#8220;Is
he giving us the slip?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; answered Pycroft.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That door leads into an inner room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no exit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it furnished?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was empty yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then what on earth can he be
doing?&#160; There is something which I don&#8217;t
understand in this manner.&#160; If ever a man was three
parts mad with terror, that man&#8217;s name is Pinner.&#160;
What can have put the shivers on him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He suspects that we are detectives,&#8221;
I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; cried Pycroft.</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes shook his head.&#160; &#8220;He
did not turn pale.&#160; He was pale when we entered
the room,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;It is just possible
that&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">His words were interrupted by a sharp
rat-tat from the direction of the inner door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the deuce is he knocking at his own door
for?&#8221; cried the clerk.</p>

<p align="justify">Again and much louder came the rat-tat-tat.&#160;
We all gazed expectantly at the closed door.&#160;
Glancing at Holmes, I saw his face turn rigid, and
he leaned forward in intense excitement.&#160; Then
suddenly came a low guggling, gargling sound, and
a brisk drumming upon woodwork.&#160; Holmes sprang
frantically across the room and pushed at the door.&#160;
It was fastened on the inner side.&#160; Following
his example, we threw ourselves upon it with all our
weight.&#160; One hinge snapped, then the other, and
down came the door with a crash.&#160; Rushing over
it, we found ourselves in the inner room.&#160; It
was empty.</p>

<p align="justify">But it was only for a moment that
we were at fault.&#160; At one corner, the corner nearest
the room which we had left, there was a second door.&#160;
Holmes sprang to it and pulled it open.&#160; A coat
and waistcoat were lying on the floor, and from a
hook behind the door, with his own braces round his
neck, was hanging the managing director of the Franco-Midland
Hardware Company.&#160; His knees were drawn up, his
head hung at a dreadful angle to his body, and the
clatter of his heels against the door made the noise
which had broken in upon our conversation.&#160; In
an instant I had caught him round the waist, and held
him up while Holmes and Pycroft untied the elastic
bands which had disappeared between the livid creases
of skin.&#160; Then we carried him into the other room,
where he lay with a clay-colored face, puffing his
purple lips in and out with every breath&#8212;&#173;a
dreadful wreck of all that he had been but five minutes
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of him, Watson?&#8221; asked
Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">I stooped over him and examined him.&#160;
His pulse was feeble and intermittent, but his breathing
grew longer, and there was a little shivering of his
eyelids, which showed a thin white slit of ball beneath.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It has been touch and go with
him,&#8221; said I, &#8220;but he&#8217;ll live now.&#160;
Just open that window, and hand me the water carafe.&#8221;&#160;
I undid his collar, poured the cold water over his
face, and raised and sank his arms until he drew a
long, natural breath.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s only a
question of time now,&#8221; said I, as I turned away
from him.</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes stood by the table, with his
hands deep in his trouser&#8217;s pockets and his
chin upon his breast.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I suppose we ought to call
the police in now,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;And
yet I confess that I&#8217;d like to give them a complete
case when they come.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It&#8217;s a blessed mystery
to me,&#8221; cried Pycroft, scratching his head.&#160;
&#8220;Whatever they wanted to bring me all the way
up here for, and then&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Pooh!&#160; All that is clear
enough,&#8221; said Holmes impatiently.&#160; &#8220;It
is this last sudden move.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand the rest, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that it is fairly obvious.&#160; What
do you say, Watson?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I shrugged my shoulders.&#160; &#8220;I
must confess that I am out of my depths,&#8221; said
I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh surely if you consider the
events at first they can only point to one conclusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you make of them?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, the whole thing hinges
upon two points.&#160; The first is the making of Pycroft
write a declaration by which he entered the service
of this preposterous company.&#160; Do you not see
how very suggestive that is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I miss the point.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, why did they want him
to do it?&#160; Not as a business matter, for these
arrangements are usually verbal, and there was no earthly
business reason why this should be an exception.&#160;
Don&#8217;t you see, my young friend, that they were
very anxious to obtain a specimen of your handwriting,
and had no other way of doing it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Quite so.&#160; Why?&#160; When
we answer that we have made some progress with our
little problem.&#160; Why?&#160; There can be only one
adequate reason.&#160; Some one wanted to learn to
imitate your writing, and had to procure a specimen
of it first.&#160; And now if we pass on to the second
point we find that each throws light upon the other.&#160;
That point is the request made by Pinner that you
should not resign your place, but should leave the
manager of this important business in the full expectation
that a Mr. Hall Pycroft, whom he had never seen, was
about to enter the office upon the Monday morning.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My God!&#8221; cried our client,
&#8220;what a blind beetle I have been!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Now you see the point about
the handwriting.&#160; Suppose that some one turned
up in your place who wrote a completely different hand
from that in which you had applied for the vacancy,
of course the game would have been up.&#160; But in
the interval the rogue had learned to imitate you,
and his position was therefore secure, as I presume
that nobody in the office had ever set eyes upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a soul,&#8221; groaned Hall Pycroft.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;V&#233;ry good.&#160; Of course it
was of the utmost importance to prevent you from thinking
better of it, and also to keep you from coming into
contact with any one who might tell you that your double
was at work in Mawson&#8217;s office.&#160; Therefore
they gave you a handsome advance on your salary, and
ran you off to the Midlands, where they gave you enough
work to do to prevent your going to London, where
you might have burst their little game up.&#160; That
is all plain enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should this man pretend to be his own
brother?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, that is pretty clear
also.&#160; There are evidently only two of them in
it.&#160; The other is impersonating you at the office.&#160;
This one acted as your <i>engager</i>, and then found
that he could not find you an employer without admitting
a third person into his plot.&#160; That he was most
unwilling to do.&#160; He changed his appearance as
far as he could, and trusted that the likeness, which
you could not fail to observe, would be put down to
a family resemblance.&#160; But for the happy chance
of the gold stuffing, your suspicions would probably
never have been aroused.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Hall Pycroft shook his clinched hands
in the air.&#160; &#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he cried,
&#8220;while I have been fooled in this way, what has
this other Hall Pycroft been doing at Mawson&#8217;s?&#160;
What should we do, Mr. Holmes?&#160; Tell me what to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must wire to Mawson&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They shut at twelve on Saturdays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind.&#160; There may be some door-keeper
or attendant&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah yes, they keep a permanent
guard there on account of the value of the securities
that they hold.&#160; I remember hearing it talked of
in the City.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;V&#233;ry good; we shall wire to
him, and see if all is well, and if a clerk of your
name is working there.&#160; That is clear enough; but
what is not so clear is why at sight of us one of
the rogues should instantly walk out of the room and
hang himself.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The paper!&#8221; croaked a
voice behind us.&#160; The man was sitting up, blanched
and ghastly, with returning reason in his eyes, and
hands which rubbed nervously at the broad red band
which still encircled his throat.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The paper!&#160; Of course!&#8221;
yelled Holmes, in a paroxysm of excitement.&#160; &#8220;Idiot
that I was!&#160; I thought so much of our visit that
the paper never entered my head for an instant.&#160;
To be sure, the secret must be there.&#8221;&#160;
He flattened it out upon the table, and a cry of triumph
burst from his lips.&#160; &#8220;Look at this, Watson,&#8221;
he cried.&#160; &#8220;It is a London paper, an early
edition of the Evening Standard.&#160; Here is what
we want.&#160; Look at the headlines:&#160; &#8217;Crime
in the City.&#160; Murder at Mawson &#38; Williams&#8217;s.&#160;
Gigantic attempted Robbery.&#160; Capture of the Criminal.&#8217;&#160;
Here, Watson, we are all equally anxious to hear it,
so kindly read it aloud to us.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It appeared from its position in the
paper to have been the one event of importance in
town, and the account of it ran in this way:&#160;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A desperate attempt at robbery,
culminating in the death of one man and the capture
of the criminal, occurred this afternoon in the City.&#160;
For some time back Mawson &#38; Williams, the famous financial
house, have been the guardians of securities which
amount in the aggregate to a sum of considerably over
a million sterling.&#160; So conscious was the manager
of the responsibility which devolved upon him in consequence
of the great interests at stake that safes of the
very latest construction have been employed, and an
armed watchman has been left day and night in the
building.&#160; It appears that last week a new clerk
named Hall Pycroft was engaged by the firm.&#160; This
person appears to have been none other that Beddington,
the famous forger and cracksman, who, with his brother,
had only recently emerged from a five years&#8217;
spell of penal servitude.&#160; By some means, which
are not yet clear, he succeeded in winning, under a
false name, this official position in the office, which
he utilized in order to obtain moulding of various
locks, and a thorough knowledge of the position of
the strong room and the safes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is customary at Mawson&#8217;s
for the clerks to leave at midday on Saturday.&#160;
<i>Sergeant</i> <i>Tus&#243;n</i>, of the City Police, was somewhat
surprised, therefore to see a gentleman with a carpet
bag come down the steps at twenty minutes past one.&#160;
His suspicions being aroused, the sergeant followed
the man, and with the aid of Constable Pollock succeeded,
after a most desperate resistance, in arresting him.&#160;
It was at once clear that a daring and gigantic robbery
had been committed.&#160; Nearly a hundred thousand
pounds&#8217; worth of American railway bonds, with
a large amount of scrip in mines and other companies,
was discovered in the bag.&#160; On examining the premises
the body of the unfortunate watchman was found doubled
up and thrust into the largest of the safes, where
it would not have been discovered until Monday morning
had it not been for the prompt action of <i>Sergeant</i>
<i>Tus&#243;n</i>.&#160; The man&#8217;s skull had been shattered
by a blow from a poker delivered from behind.&#160;
There could be no doubt that Beddington had obtained
entrance by pretending that he had left something
behind him, and having murdered the watchman, rapidly
rifled the large safe, and then made off with his
booty.&#160; His brother, who usually works with him,
has not appeared in this job as far as can at present
be ascertained, although the police are making energetic
inquiries as to his whereabouts.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, we may save the police
some little trouble in that direction,&#8221; said
Holmes, glancing at the haggard figure huddled up by
the window.&#160; &#8220;Human nature is a strange
mixture, Watson.&#160; You see that even a villain
and murderer can inspire such affection that his brother
turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is forfeited.&#160;
However, we have no choice as to our action.&#160;
The doctor and I will remain on guard, Mr. Pycroft,
if you will have the kindness to step out for the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adventure IV.&#160; The &#8220;<i>Gloria Scott</i>&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have some papers here,&#8221;
said my friend Sherlock Holmes, as we sat one winter&#8217;s
night on either side of the fire, &#8220;which I really
think, Watson, that it would be worth your while to
glance over.&#160; These are the documents in the extraordinary
case of the Gloria Scott, and this is the message
which struck Justice of the Peace Trevor dead with
horror when he read it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He had picked from a drawer a little
tarnished cylinder, and, undoing the tape, he handed
me a short note scrawled upon a half-sheet of slate-gray
paper.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The supply of game for London
is going steadily up,&#8221; it ran.&#160; &#8220;Head-keeper
Hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all
orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your
hen-pheasant&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As I glanced up from reading this
enigmatical message, I saw Holmes chuckling at the
expression upon my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look a little bewildered,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot see how such a message
as this could inspire horror.&#160; It seems to me
to be rather grotesque than otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;V&#233;ry likely.&#160; Yet the fact
remains that the reader, who was a fine, robust old
man, was knocked clean down by it as if it had been
the butt end of a pistol.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You arouse my curiosity,&#8221;
said I.&#160; &#8220;But why did you say just now that
there were very particular reasons why I should study
this case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it was the first in which I was ever
engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had often endeavored to elicit from
my companion what had first turned his mind in the
direction of criminal research, but had never caught
him before in a communicative humor.&#160; Now he sat
forward in this arm-chair and spread out the documents
upon his knees.&#160; Then he lit his pipe and sat
for some time smoking and turning them over.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You never heard me talk of
Victor Trevor?&#8221; he asked.&#160; &#8220;He was
the only friend I made during the two years I was
at college.&#160; I was never a very sociable fellow,
Watson, always rather fond of moping in my rooms and
working out my own little methods of thought, so that
I never mixed much with the men of my year.&#160; Bar
fencing and boxing I had few athletic tastes, and
then my line of study was quite distinct from that
of the other fellows, so that we had no points of
contact at all.&#160; Trevor was the only man I knew,
and that only through the accident of his bull terrier
freezing on to my ankle one morning as I went down
to chapel.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was a prosaic way of forming
a friendship, but it was effective.&#160; I was laid
by the heels for ten days, but Trevor used to come
in to inquire after me.&#160; At first it was only
a minute&#8217;s chat, but soon his visits lengthened,
and before the end of the term we were close friends.&#160;
He was a hearty, full-blooded fellow, full of spirits
and energy, the very opposite to me in most respects,
but we had some subjects in common, and it was a bond
of union when I found that he was as friendless as
I. Finally, he invited me down to his father&#8217;s
place at Donnithorpe, in Norfolk, and I accepted his
hospitality for a month of the long vacation.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Old Trevor was evidently a
man of some wealth and consideration, a J.P., and
a landed proprietor.&#160; Donnithorpe is a little hamlet
just to the north of Langmere, in the country of the
Broads.&#160; The house was an old-fashioned, wide-spread,
oak-beamed brick building, with a fine lime-lined
avenue leading up to it.&#160; There was excellent wild-duck
shooting in the fens, remarkably good fishing, a small
but select library, taken over, as I understood, from
a former occupant, and a tolerable cook, so that he
would be a fastidious man who could not put in a pleasant
month there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trevor senior was a widower, and my friend
his only son.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There had been a daughter,
I heard, but she had died of diphtheria while on a
visit to Birmingham.&#160; The father interested me
extremely.&#160; He was a man of little culture, but
with a considerable amount of rude strength, both
physically and mentally.&#160; He knew hardly any books,
but he had traveled far, had seen much of the world.&#160;
And had remembered all that he had learned.&#160; In
person he was a thick-set, burly man with a shock
of grizzled hair, a brown, weather-beaten face, and
blue eyes which were keen to the verge of fierceness.&#160;
Yet he had a reputation for kindness and charity on
the country-side, and was noted for the leniency of
his sentences from the bench.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;One evening, shortly after
my arrival, we were sitting over a glass of port after
dinner, when young Trevor began to talk about those
habits of observation and inference which I had already
formed into a system, although I had not yet appreciated
the part which they were to play in my life.&#160;
The old man evidently thought that his son was exaggerating
in his description of one or two trivial feats which
I had performed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Come, now, Mr. Holmes,&#8217;
said he, laughing good-humoredly.&#160; &#8217;I&#8217;m
an excellent subject, if you can deduce anything from
me.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I fear there is not
very much,&#8217; I answered; &#8217;I might suggest
that you have gone about in fear of some personal
attack within the last twelvemonth.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The laugh faded from his lips,
and he stared at me in great surprise.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Well, that&#8217;s true
enough,&#8217; said he.&#160; &#8216;You know, Victor,&#8217;
turning to his son, &#8217;when we broke up that poaching
gang they swore to knife us, and Sir Edward Holly
has actually been attacked.&#160; I&#8217;ve always
been on my guard since then, though I have no idea
how you know it.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You have a very handsome
stick,&#8217; I answered.&#160; &#8217;By the inscription
I observed that you had not had it more than a year.&#160;
But you have taken some pains to bore the head of
it and pour melted lead into the hole so as to make
it a formidable weapon.&#160; I argued that you would
not take such precautions unless you had some danger
to fear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Anything else?&#8217; he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You have boxed a good deal in your youth.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Right again.&#160; How
did you know it?&#160; Is my nose knocked a little out
of the straight?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; said I.&#160;
&#8217;It is your ears.&#160; They have the peculiar
flattening and thickening which marks the boxing man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Anything else?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You have done a good deal of digging
by your callosities.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Made all my money at the gold fields.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You have been in New Zealand.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Right again.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You have visited Japan.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Quite true.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;And you have been most
intimately associated with some one whose initials
were J. A., and whom you afterwards were eager to entirely
forget.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mr. Trevor stood slowly up,
fixed his large blue eyes upon me with a strange wild
stare, and then pitched forward, with his face among
the nutshells which strewed the cloth, in a dead faint.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You can imagine, Watson, how
shocked both his son and I were.&#160; His attack did
not last long, however, for when we undid his collar,
and sprinkled the water from one of the finger-glasses
over his face, he gave a gasp or two and sat up.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Ah, boys,&#8217; said
he, forcing a smile, &#8217;I hope I haven&#8217;t
frightened you.&#160; Strong as I look, there is a
weak place in my heart, and it does not take much
to knock me over.&#160; I don&#8217;t know how you manage
this, Mr. Holmes, but it seems to me that all the
detectives of fact and of fancy would be children
in your hands.&#160; That&#8217;s your line of life,
sir, and you may take the word of a man who has seen
something of the world.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And that recommendation, with
the exaggerated estimate of my ability with which
he prefaced it, was, if you will believe me, Watson,
the very first thing which ever made me feel that
a profession might be made out of what had up to that
time been the merest hobby.&#160; At the moment, however,
I was too much concerned at the sudden illness of my
host to think of anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I hope that I have said nothing to pain
you?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Well, you certainly
touched upon rather a tender point.&#160; Might I ask
how you know, and how much you know?&#8217; He spoke
now in a half-jesting fashion, but a look of terror
still lurked at the back of his eyes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;It is simplicity itself,&#8217;
said I.&#160; &#8217;When you bared your arm to draw
that fish into the boat I saw that J. A. Had been tattooed
in the bend of the elbow.&#160; The letters were still
legible, but it was perfectly clear from their blurred
appearance, and from the staining of the skin round
them, that efforts had been made to obliterate them.&#160;
It was obvious, then, that those initials had once
been very familiar to you, and that you had afterwards
wished to forget them.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What an eye you have!&#8221;
he cried, with a sigh of relief.&#160; &#8217;It is
just as you say.&#160; But we won&#8217;t talk of it.&#160;
Of all ghosts the ghosts of our old lovers are the
worst.&#160; Come into the billiard-room and have a
quiet cigar.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;From that day, amid all his
cordiality, there was always a touch of suspicion
in Mr. Trevor&#8217;s manner towards me.&#160; Even
his son remarked it.&#160; &#8216;You&#8217;ve given
the governor such a turn,&#8217; said he, &#8217;that
he&#8217;ll never be sure again of what you know and
what you don&#8217;t know.&#8217;&#160; He did not mean
to show it, I am sure, but it was so strongly in his
mind that it peeped out at every action.&#160; At last
I became so convinced that I was causing him uneasiness
that I drew my visit to a close.&#160; On the very day,
however, before I left, and incident occurred which
proved in the sequel to be of importance.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We were sitting out upon the
lawn on garden chairs, the three of us, basking in
the sun and admiring the view across the Broads, when
a maid came out to say that there was a man at the
door who wanted to see Mr. Trevor.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What is his name?&#8217; asked my host.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He would not give any.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What does he want, then?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;He says that you know
him, and that he only wants a moment&#8217;s conversation.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Show him round here.&#8217;&#160;
An instant afterwards there appeared a little wizened
fellow with a cringing manner and a shambling style
of walking.&#160; He wore an open jacket, with a splotch
of tar on the sleeve, a red-and-black check shirt,
dungaree trousers, and heavy boots badly worn.&#160;
His face was thin and brown and crafty, with a perpetual
smile upon it, which showed an irregular line of yellow
teeth, and his crinkled hands were half closed in
a way that is distinctive of sailors.&#160; As he came
slouching across the lawn I heard Mr. Trevor make a
sort of hiccoughing noise in his throat, and jumping
out of his chair, he ran into the house.&#160; He was
back in a moment, and I smelt a strong reek of brandy
as he passed me.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, my man,&#8217; said he.&#160; &#8216;What
can I do for you?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The sailor stood looking at
him with puckered eyes, and with the same loose-lipped
smile upon his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You don&#8217;t know me?&#8217; he asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Why, dear me, it is
surely Hudson,&#8217; said Mr. Trevor in a tone of
surprise.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Hudson it is, sir,&#8217;
said the seaman.&#160; &#8217;Why, it&#8217;s thirty
year and more since I saw you last.&#160; Here you
are in your house, and me still picking my salt meat
out of the harness cask.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Tut, you will find that
I have not forgotten old times,&#8217; cried Mr. Trevor,
and, walking towards the sailor, he said something
in a low voice.&#160; &#8216;Go into the kitchen,&#8217;
he continued out loud, &#8217;and you will get food
and drink.&#160; I have no doubt that I shall find you
a situation.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Thank you, sir,&#8217;
said the seaman, touching his fore-lock.&#160; &#8217;I&#8217;m
just off a two-yearer in an eight-knot tramp, short-handed
at that, and I wants a rest.&#160; I thought I&#8217;d
get it either with Mr. Beddoes or with you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah!&#8217; cried Trevor.&#160; &#8216;You
know where Mr. Beddoes is?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Bless you, sir, I know
where all my old friends are,&#8217; said the fellow
with a sinister smile, and he slouched off after the
maid to the kitchen.&#160; Mr. Trevor mumbled something
to us about having been shipmate with the man when
he was going back to the diggings, and then, leaving
us on the lawn, he went indoors.&#160; An hour later,
when we entered the house, we found him stretched
dead drunk upon the dining-room sofa.&#160; The whole
incident left a most ugly impression upon my mind,
and I was not sorry next day to leave Donnithorpe
behind me, for I felt that my presence must be a source
of embarrassment to my friend.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;All this occurred during the
first month of the long vacation.&#160; I went up to
my London rooms, where I spent seven weeks working
out a few experiments in organic chemistry.&#160; One
day, however, when the autumn was far advanced and
the vacation drawing to a close, I received a telegram
from my friend imploring me to return to Donnithorpe,
and saying that he was in great need of my advice
and assistance.&#160; Of course I dropped everything
and set out for the North once more.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He met me with the dog-cart
at the station, and I saw at a glance that the last
two months had been very trying ones for him.&#160;
He had grown thin and careworn, and had lost the loud,
cheery manner for which he had been remarkable.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The governor is dying,&#8217; were the
first words he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Impossible!&#8217; I cried.&#160; &#8216;What
is the matter?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Apoplexy.&#160; Nervous
shock, He&#8217;s been on the verge all day.&#160; I
doubt if we shall find him alive.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was, as you may think, Watson, horrified
at this unexpected news.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What has caused it?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Ah, that is the point.&#160;
Jump in and we can talk it over while we drive.&#160;
You remember that fellow who came upon the evening
before you left us?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Perfectly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you know who it was that we let into
the house that day?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have no idea.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It was the devil, Holmes,&#8217; he
cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Yes, it was the devil
himself.&#160; We have not had a peaceful hour since&#8212;&#173;not
one.&#160; The governor has never held up his head from
that evening, and now the life has been crushed out
of him and his heart broken, all through this accursed
Hudson.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What power had he, then?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Ah, that is what I would
give so much to know.&#160; The kindly, charitable,
good old governor&#8212;&#173;how could he have fallen
into the clutches of such a ruffian!&#160; But I am
so glad that you have come, Holmes.&#160; I trust very
much to your judgment and discretion, and I know that
you will advise me for the best.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We were dashing along the smooth
white country road, with the long stretch of the Broads
in front of us glimmering in the red light of the
setting sun.&#160; From a grove upon our left I could
already see the high chimneys and the flag-staff which
marked the squire&#8217;s dwelling.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;My father made the fellow
gardener,&#8217; said my companion, &#8217;and then,
as that did not satisfy him, he was promoted to be
butler.&#160; The house seemed to be at his mercy,
and he wandered about and did what he chose in it.&#160;
The maids complained of his drunken habits and his
vile language.&#160; The dad raised their wages all
round to recompense them for the annoyance.&#160; The
fellow would take the boat and my father&#8217;s best
gun and treat himself to little shooting trips.&#160;
And all this with such a sneering, leering, insolent
face that I would have knocked him down twenty times
over if he had been a man of my own age.&#160; I tell
you, Holmes, I have had to keep a tight hold upon
myself all this time; and now I am asking myself whether,
if I had let myself go a little more, I might not have
been a wiser man.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Well, matters went from
bad to worse with us, and this animal Hudson became
more and more intrusive, until at last, on making some
insolent reply to my father in my presence one day,
I took him by the shoulders and turned him out of
the room.&#160; He slunk away with a livid face and
two venomous eyes which uttered more threats than
his tongue could do.&#160; I don&#8217;t know what
passed between the poor dad and him after that, but
the dad came to me next day and asked me whether I
would mind apologizing to Hudson.&#160; I refused,
as you can imagine, and asked my father how he could
allow such a wretch to take such liberties with himself
and his household.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"Ah, my boy,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;it is all very well to talk, but you
don&#8217;t know how I am placed.&#160; But you shall
know, Victor.&#160; I&#8217;ll see that you shall know,
come what may.&#160; You wouldn&#8217;t believe harm
of your poor old father, would you, lad?&#8221; He
was very much moved, and shut himself up in the study
all day, where I could see through the window that
he was writing busily.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;That evening there came
what seemed to me to be a grand release, for Hudson
told us that he was going to leave us.&#160; He walked
into the dining-room as we sat after dinner, and announced
his intention in the thick voice of a half-drunken
man.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"I&#8217;ve had enough
of Norfolk,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
run down to Mr. Beddoes in Hampshire.&#160; He&#8217;ll
be as glad to see me as you were, I dare say.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"You&#8217;re not going
away in an unkind spirit, Hudson, I hope,&#8221; said
my father, with a tameness which made my blood boil.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"I&#8217;ve not had
my &#8217;pology,&#8221; said he sulkily, glancing
in my direction.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"Victor, you will acknowledge
that you have used this worthy fellow rather roughly,&#8221;
said the dad, turning to me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"On the contrary, I
think that we have both shown extraordinary patience
towards him,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"Oh, you do, do you?&#8221;
he snarls.&#160; &#8220;V&#233;ry good, mate.&#160; We&#8217;ll
see about that!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;He slouched out of the
room, and half an hour afterwards left the house,
leaving my father in a state of pitiable nervousness.&#160;
Night after night I heard him pacing his room, and
it was just as he was recovering his confidence that
the blow did at last fall.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And how?&#8217; I asked eagerly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;In a most extraordinary
fashion.&#160; A letter arrived for my father yesterday
evening, bearing the Fordingbridge post-mark.&#160;
My father read it, clapped both his hands to his head,
and began running round the room in little circles
like a man who has been driven out of his senses.&#160;
When I at last drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth
and eyelids were all puckered on one side, and I saw
that he had a stroke.&#160; Dr. Fordham came over at
once.&#160; We put him to bed; but the paralysis has
spread, he has shown no sign of returning consciousness,
and I think that we shall hardly find him alive.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You horrify me, Trevor!&#8217;
I cried.&#160; &#8217;What then could have been in this
letter to cause so dreadful a result?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Nothing.&#160; There
lies the inexplicable part of it.&#160; The message
was absurd and trivial.&#160; Ah, my God, it is as
I feared!&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;As he spoke we came round the
curve of the avenue, and saw in the fading light that
every blind in the house had been drawn down.&#160;
As we dashed up to the door, my friend&#8217;s face
convulsed with grief, a gentleman in black emerged
from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;When did it happen, doctor?&#8217; asked
Trevor.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Almost immediately after you left.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Did he recover consciousness?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;For an instant before the end.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Any message for me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Only that the papers were in the back
drawer of the Japanese cabinet.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My friend ascended with the
doctor to the chamber of death, while I remained in
the study, turning the whole matter over and over in
my head, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done
in my life.&#160; What was the past of this Trevor,
pugilist, traveler, and gold-digger, and how had he
placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman?&#160;
Why, too, should he faint at an allusion to the half-effaced
initials upon his arm, and die of fright when he had
a letter from Fordingham?&#160; Then I remembered that
Fordingham was in Hampshire, and that this Mr. Beddoes,
whom the seaman had gone to visit and presumably to
blackmail, had also been mentioned as living in Hampshire.&#160;
The letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the
seaman, saying that he had betrayed the guilty secret
which appeared to exist, or it might come from Beddoes,
warning an old confederate that such a betrayal was
imminent.&#160; So far it seemed clear enough.&#160;
But then how could this letter be trivial and grotesque,
as describe by the son?&#160; He must have misread
it.&#160; If so, it must have been one of those ingenious
secret codes which mean one thing while they seem
to mean another.&#160; I must see this letter.&#160;
If there were a hidden meaning in it, I was confident
that I could pluck it forth.&#160; For an hour I sat
pondering over it in the gloom, until at last a weeping
maid brought in a lamp, and close at her heels came
my friend Trevor, pale but composed, with these very
papers which lie upon my knee held in his grasp.&#160;
He sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp to the edge
of the table, and handed me a short note scribbled,
as you see, upon a single sheet of gray paper.&#160;
&#8216;The supply of game for London is going steadily
up,&#8217; it ran.&#160; &#8217;Head-keeper Hudson,
we believe, has been now told to receive all orders
for fly-paper and for preservation of your hen-pheasant&#8217;s
life.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I dare say my face looked as
bewildered as yours did just now when first I read
this message.&#160; Then I reread it very carefully.&#160;
It was evidently as I had thought, and some secret
meaning must lie buried in this strange combination
of words.&#160; Or could it be that there was a prearranged
significance to such phrases as &#8216;fly-paper&#8217;
and &#8216;hen-pheasant&#8217;?&#160; Such a meaning
would be arbitrary and could not be deduced in any
way.&#160; And yet I was loath to believe that this
was the case, and the presence of the word Hudson
seemed to show that the subject of the message was
as I had guessed, and that it was from Beddoes rather
than the sailor.&#160; I tried it backwards, but the
combination &#8216;life pheasant&#8217;s hen&#8217;
was not encouraging.&#160; Then I tried alternate words,
but neither &#8216;the of for&#8217; nor &#8216;supply
game London&#8217; promised to throw any light upon
it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And then in an instant the
key of the riddle was in my hands, and I saw that
every third word, beginning with the first, would give
a message which might well drive old Trevor to despair.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was short and terse, the
warning, as I now read it to my companion:&#160;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;The game is up.&#160;
Hudson has told all.&#160; Fly for your life.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Victor Trevor sank his face
into his shaking hands.&#160; &#8217;It must be that,
I suppose,&#8217; said he.&#160; &#8220;This is worse
than death, for it means disgrace as well.&#160; But
what is the meaning of these &#8220;head-keepers&#8221;
and &#8220;hen-pheasants"?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;It means nothing to
the message, but it might mean a good deal to us if
we had no other means of discovering the sender.&#160;
You see that he has begun by writing &#8220;The...game...is,&#8221;
and so on.&#160; Afterwards he had, to fulfill the
prearranged cipher, to fill in any two words in each
space.&#160; He would naturally use the first words
which came to his mind, and if there were so many
which referred to sport among them, you may be tolerably
sure that he is either an ardent shot or interested
in breeding.&#160; Do you know anything of this Beddoes?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Why, now that you mention
it,&#8217; said he, &#8217;I remember that my poor
father used to have an invitation from him to shoot
over his preserves every autumn.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Then it is undoubtedly
from him that the note comes,&#8217; said I.&#160; &#8217;It
only remains for us to find out what this secret was
which the sailor Hudson seems to have held over the
heads of these two wealthy and respected men.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Alas, Holmes, I fear
that it is one of sin and shame!&#8217; cried my friend.&#160;
&#8217;But from you I shall have no secrets.&#160; Here
is the statement which was drawn up by my father when
he knew that the danger from Hudson had become imminent.&#160;
I found it in the Japanese cabinet, as he told the
doctor.&#160; Take it and read it to me, for I have
neither the strength nor the courage to do it myself.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;These are the very papers,
Watson, which he handed to me, and I will read them
to you, as I read them in the old study that night
to him.&#160; They are endorsed outside, as you see,
&#8217;Some particulars of the voyage of the bark
<i>Gloria Scott</i>, from her leaving Falmouth on the
8th October, 1855, to her destruction in N. Lat. 15
degrees 20&#8217;, W. Long. 25 degrees 14&#8217; on
Nov. 6th.&#8217;&#160; It is in the form of a letter,
and runs in this way:&#160;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;My dear, dear son, now
that approaching disgrace begins to darken the closing
years of my life, I can write with all truth and honesty
that it is not the terror of the law, it is not the
loss of my position in the county, nor is it my fall
in the eyes of all who have known me, which cuts me
to the heart; but it is the thought that you should
come to blush for me&#8212;&#173;you who love me and
who have seldom, I hope, had reason to do other than
respect me.&#160; But if the blow falls which is forever
hanging over me, then I should wish you to read this,
that you may know straight from me how far I have
been to blame.&#160; On the other hand, if all should
go well (which may kind God Almighty grant!), then
if by any chance this paper should be still undestroyed
and should fall into your hands, I conjure you, by
all you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear mother,
and by the love which had been between us, to hurl
it into the fire and to never give one thought to
it again.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;If then your eye goes
on to read this line, I know that I shall already
have been exposed and dragged from my home, or as is
more likely, for you know that my heart is weak, by
lying with my tongue sealed forever in death.&#160;
In either case the time for suppression is past, and
every word which I tell you is the naked truth, and
this I swear as I hope for mercy.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;My name, dear lad, is
not Trevor.&#160; I was James Armitage in my younger
days, and you can understand now the shock that it
was to me a few weeks ago when your college friend
addressed me in words which seemed to imply that he
had surprised my secret.&#160; As Armitage it was that
I entered a London banking-house, and as Armitage
I was convicted of breaking my country&#8217;s laws,
and was sentenced to transportation.&#160; Do not think
very harshly of me, laddie.&#160; It was a debt of
honor, so called, which I had to pay, and I used money
which was not my own to do it, in the certainty that
I could replace it before there could be any possibility
of its being missed.&#160; But the most dreadful ill-luck
pursued me.&#160; The money which I had reckoned upon
never came to hand, and a premature examination of
accounts exposed my deficit.&#160; The case might have
been dealt leniently with, but the laws were more
harshly administered thirty years ago than now, and
on my twenty-third birthday I found myself chained
as a felon with thirty-seven other convicts in &#8217;tween-decks
of the bark <i>Gloria Scott</i>, bound for Australia.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;It was the year &#8217;55
when the Crimean war was at its height, and the old
convict ships had been largely used as transports in
the Black Sea.&#160; The government was compelled,
therefore, to use smaller and less suitable vessels
for sending out their prisoners.&#160; The Gloria Scott
had been in the Chinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned,
heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new clippers
had cut her out.&#160; She was a five-hundred-ton boat;
and besides her thirty-eight jail-birds, she carried
twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a captain,
three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders.&#160;
Nearly a hundred souls were in her, all told, when
we set sail from Falmouth.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;The partitions between
the cells of the convicts, instead of being of thick
oak, as is usual in convict-ships, were quite thin
and frail.&#160; The man next to me, upon the aft side,
was one whom I had particularly noticed when we were
led down the quay.&#160; He was a young man with a
clear, hairless face, a long, thin nose, and rather
nut-cracker jaws.&#160; He carried his head very jauntily
in the air, had a swaggering style of walking, and
was, above all else, remarkable for his extraordinary
height.&#160; I don&#8217;t think any of our heads would
have come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he
could not have measured less than six and a half feet.&#160;
It was strange among so many sad and weary faces to
see one which was full of energy and resolution.&#160;
The sight of it was to me like a fire in a snow-storm.&#160;
I was glad, then, to find that he was my neighbor,
and gladder still when, in the dead of the night, I
heard a whisper close to my ear, and found that he
had managed to cut an opening in the board which separated
us.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"Hullo, chummy!&#8221;
said he, &#8220;what&#8217;s your name, and what are
you here for?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;I answered him, and
asked in turn who I was talking with.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"I&#8217;m Jack Prendergast,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and by God!&#160; You&#8217;ll learn
to bless my name before you&#8217;ve done with me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;I remembered hearing
of his case, for it was one which had made an immense
sensation throughout the country some time before my
own arrest.&#160; He was a man of good family and of
great ability, but of incurably vicious habits, who
had by an ingenious system of fraud obtained huge
sums of money from the leading London merchants.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"Ha, ha!&#160; You remember my case!&#8221;
said he proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"V&#233;ry well, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"Then maybe you remember something queer
about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"What was that, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"I&#8217;d had nearly a quarter of a
million, hadn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"So it was said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"But none was recovered, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"Well, where d&#8217;ye suppose the
balance is?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"I have no idea,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"Right between my finger
and thumb,&#8221; he cried.&#160; &#8220;By God!&#160;
I&#8217;ve got more pounds to my name than you&#8217;ve
hairs on your head.&#160; And if you&#8217;ve money,
my son, and know how to handle it and spread it, you
can do anything.&#160; Now, you don&#8217;t think it
likely that a man who could do anything is going to
wear his breeches out sitting in the stinking hold
of a rat-gutted, beetle-ridden, mouldy old coffin
of a Chin China coaster.&#160; No, sir, such a man
will look after himself and will look after his chums.&#160;
You may lay to that!&#160; You hold on to him, and
you may kiss the book that he&#8217;ll haul you through.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;That was his style of
talk, and at first I thought it meant nothing; but
after a while, when he had tested me and sworn me in
with all possible solemnity, he let me understand
that there really was a plot to gain command of the
vessel.&#160; A dozen of the prisoners had hatched it
before they came aboard, Prendergast was the leader,
and his money was the motive power.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"I&#8217;d a partner,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;a rare good man, as true as a stock
to a barrel.&#160; He&#8217;s got the dibbs, he has,
and where do you think he is at this moment?&#160;
Why, he&#8217;s the chaplain of this ship&#8212;&#173;the
chaplain, no less!&#160; He came aboard with a black
coat, and his papers right, and money enough in his
box to buy the thing right up from keel to main-truck.&#160;
The crew are his, body and soul.&#160; He could buy
&#8217;em at so much a gross with a cash discount,
and he did it before ever they signed on.&#160; He&#8217;s
got two of the warders and Mereer, the second mate,
and he&#8217;d get the captain himself, if he thought
him worth it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"What are we to do, then?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"What do you think?&#8221;
said he.&#160; &#8220;We&#8217;ll make the coats of
some of these soldiers redder than ever the tailor
did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"But they are armed,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"And so shall we be,
my boy.&#160; There&#8217;s a brace of pistols for every
mother&#8217;s son of us, and if we can&#8217;t carry
this ship, with the crew at our back, it&#8217;s time
we were all sent to a young misses&#8217; boarding-school.&#160;
You speak to your mate upon the left to-night, and
see if he is to be trusted.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;I did so, and found
my other neighbor to be a young fellow in much the
same position as myself, whose crime had been forgery.&#160;
His name was Evans, but he afterwards changed it,
like myself, and he is now a rich and prosperous man
in the south of England.&#160; He was ready enough to
join the conspiracy, as the only means of saving ourselves,
and before we had crossed the Bay there were only
two of the prisoners who were not in the secret.&#160;
One of these was of weak mind, and we did not dare
to trust him, and the other was suffering from jaundice,
and could not be of any use to us.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;From the beginning there
was really nothing to prevent us from taking possession
of the ship.&#160; The crew were a set of ruffians,
specially picked for the job.&#160; The sham chaplain
came into our cells to exhort us, carrying a black
bag, supposed to be full of tracts, and so often did
he come that by the third day we had each stowed away
at the foot of our beds a file, a brace of pistols,
a pound of powder, and twenty slugs.&#160; Two of the
warders were agents of Prendergast, and the second
mate was his right-hand man.&#160; The captain, the
two mates, two warders Lieutenant Martin, his eighteen
soldiers, and the doctor were all that we had against
us.&#160; Yet, safe as it was, we determined to neglect
no precaution, and to make our attack suddenly by
night.&#160; It came, however, more quickly than we
expected, and in this way.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;One evening, about the
third week after our start, the doctor had come down
to see one of the prisoners who was ill, and putting
his hand down on the bottom of his bunk he felt the
outline of the pistols.&#160; If he had been silent
he might have blown the whole thing, but he was a nervous
little chap, so he gave a cry of surprise and turned
so pale that the man knew what was up in an instant
and seized him.&#160; He was gagged before he could
give the alarm, and tied down upon the bed.&#160; He
had unlocked the door that led to the deck, and we
were through it in a rush.&#160; The two sentries were
shot down, and so was a corporal who came running to
see what was the matter.&#160; There were two more
soldiers at the door of the state-room, and their
muskets seemed not to be loaded, for they never fired
upon us, and they were shot while trying to fix their
bayonets.&#160; Then we rushed on into the captain&#8217;s
cabin, but as we pushed open the door there was an
explosion from within, and there he lay with his brains
smeared over the chart of the Atlantic which was pinned
upon the table, while the chaplain stood with a smoking
pistol in his hand at his elbow.&#160; The two mates
had both been seized by the crew, and the whole business
seemed to be settled.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;The state-room was next
the cabin, and we flocked in there and flopped down
on the settees, all speaking together, for we were
just mad with the feeling that we were free once more.&#160;
There were lockers all round, and Wilson, the sham
chaplain, knocked one of them in, and pulled out a
dozen of brown sherry.&#160; We cracked off the necks
of the bottles, poured the stuff out into tumblers,
and were just tossing them off, when in an instant
without warning there came the roar of muskets in our
ears, and the saloon was so full of smoke that we
could not see across the table.&#160; When it cleared
again the place was a shambles.&#160; Wilson and eight
others were wriggling on the top of each other on
the floor, and the blood and the brown sherry on that
table turn me sick now when I think of it.&#160; We
were so cowed by the sight that I think we should have
given the job up if it had not been for Prendergast.&#160;
He bellowed like a bull and rushed for the door with
all that were left alive at his heels.&#160; Out we
ran, and there on the poop were the lieutenant and
ten of his men.&#160; The swing skylights above the
saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired
on us through the slit.&#160; We got on them before
they could load, and they stood to it like men; but
we had the upper hand of them, and in five minutes
it was all over.&#160; My God!&#160; Was there ever a
slaughter-house like that ship!&#160; Prendergast was
like a raging devil, and he picked the soldiers up
as if they had been children and threw them overboard
alive or dead.&#160; There was one sergeant that was
horribly wounded and yet kept on swimming for a surprising
time, until some one in mercy blew out his brains.&#160;
When the fighting was over there was no one left of
our enemies except just the warders the mates, and
the doctor.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;It was over them that
the great quarrel arose.&#160; There were many of us
who were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet
who had no wish to have murder on our souls.&#160;
It was one thing to knock the soldiers over with their
muskets in their hands, and it was another to stand
by while men were being killed in cold blood.&#160;
Eight of us, five convicts and three sailors, said
that we would not see it done.&#160; But there was no
moving Prendergast and those who were with him.&#160;
Our only chance of safety lay in making a clean job
of it, said he, and he would not leave a tongue with
power to wag in a witness-box.&#160; It nearly came
to our sharing the fate of the prisoners, but at last
he said that if we wished we might take a boat and
go.&#160; We jumped at the offer, for we were already
sick of these bloodthirsty doings, and we saw that
there would be worse before it was done.&#160; We were
given a suit of sailor togs each, a barrel of water,
two casks, one of junk and one of biscuits, and a compass.&#160;
Prendergast threw us over a chart, told us that we
were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had foundered
in Lat. 15 degrees and Long 25 degrees west, and then
cut the painter and let us go.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;And now I come to the
most surprising part of my story, my dear son.&#160;
The seamen had hauled the fore-yard aback during the
rising, but now as we left them they brought it square
again, and as there was a light wind from the north
and east the bark began to draw slowly away from us.&#160;
Our boat lay, rising and falling, upon the long, smooth
rollers, and Evans and I, who were the most educated
of the party, were sitting in the sheets working out
our position and planning what coast we should make
for.&#160; It was a nice question, for the Cape de Verdes
were about five hundred miles to the north of us,
and the African coast about seven hundred to the east.&#160;
On the whole, as the wind was coming round to the
north, we thought that Sierra Leone might be best,
and turned our head in that direction, the bark being
at that time nearly hull down on our starboard quarter.&#160;
Suddenly as we looked at her we saw a dense black
cloud of smoke shoot up from her, which hung like a
monstrous tree upon the sky line.&#160; A few seconds
later a roar like thunder burst upon our ears, and
as the smoke thinned away there was no sign left of
the <i>Gloria Scott</i>.&#160; In an instant we swept
the boat&#8217;s head round again and pulled with
all our strength for the place where the haze still
trailing over the water marked the scene of this catastrophe.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;It was a long hour before
we reached it, and at first we feared that we had
come too late to save any one.&#160; A splintered boat
and a number of crates and fragments of spars rising
and falling on the waves showed us where the vessel
had foundered; but there was no sign of life, and we
had turned away in despair when we heard a cry for
help, and saw at some distance a piece of wreckage
with a man lying stretched across it.&#160; When we
pulled him aboard the boat he proved to be a young
seaman of the name of Hudson, who was so burned and
exhausted that he could give us no account of what
had happened until the following morning.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;It seemed that after
we had left, Prendergast and his gang had proceeded
to put to death the five remaining prisoners.&#160;
The two warders had been shot and thrown overboard,
and so also had the third mate.&#160; Prendergast then
descended into the &#8217;tween-decks and with his
own hands cut the throat of the unfortunate surgeon.&#160;
There only remained the first mate, who was a bold
and active man.&#160; When he saw the convict approaching
him with the bloody knife in his hand he kicked off
his bonds, which he had somehow contrived to loosen,
and rushing down the deck he plunged into the after-hold.&#160;
A dozen convicts, who descended with their pistols
in search of him, found him with a match-box in his
hand seated beside an open powder-barrel, which was
one of a hundred carried on board, and swearing that
he would blow all hands up if he were in any way molested.&#160;
An instant later the explosion occurred, though Hudson
thought it was caused by the misdirected bullet of
one of the convicts rather than the mate&#8217;s match.&#160;
Be the cause what it may, it was the end of the <i>Gloria
Scott</i> and of the rabble who held command of her.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Such, in a few words,
my dear boy, is the history of this terrible business
in which I was involved.&#160; Next day we were picked
up by the brig <i>Hotspur</i>, bound for Australia,
whose captain found no difficulty in believing that
we were the survivors of a passenger ship which had
foundered.&#160; The transport ship Gloria Scott was
set down by the Admiralty as being lost at sea, and
no word has ever leaked out as to her true fate.&#160;
After an excellent voyage the <i>Hotspur</i> landed
us at Sydney, where Evans and I changed our names
and made our way to the diggings, where, among the
crowds who were gathered from all nations, we had no
difficulty in losing our former identities.&#160; The
rest I need not relate.&#160; We prospered, we traveled,
we came back as rich colonials to England, and we
bought country estates.&#160; For more than twenty years
we have led peaceful and useful lives, and we hoped
that our past was forever buried.&#160; Imagine, then,
my feelings when in the seaman who came to us I recognized
instantly the man who had been picked off the wreck.&#160;
He had tracked us down somehow, and had set himself
to live upon our fears.&#160; You will understand now
how it was that I strove to keep the peace with him,
and you will in some measure sympathize with me in
the fears which fill me, now that he has gone from
me to his other victim with threats upon his tongue.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Underneath is written in a
hand so shaky as to be hardly legible, &#8217;Beddoes
writes in cipher to say H. Has told all.&#160; Sweet
Lord, have mercy on our souls!&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That was the narrative which
I read that night to young Trevor, and I think, Watson,
that under the circumstances it was a dramatic one.&#160;
The good fellow was heart-broken at it, and went out
to the Terai tea planting, where I hear that he is
doing well.&#160; As to the sailor and Beddoes, neither
of them was ever heard of again after that day on which
the letter of warning was written.&#160; They both disappeared
utterly and completely.&#160; No complaint had been
lodged with the police, so that Beddoes had mistaken
a threat for a deed.&#160; Hudson had been seen lurking
about, and it was believed by the police that he had
done away with Beddoes and had fled.&#160; For myself
I believe that the truth was exactly the opposite.&#160;
I think that it is most probable that Beddoes, pushed
to desperation and believing himself to have been
already betrayed, had revenged himself upon Hudson,
and had fled from the country with as much money as
he could lay his hands on.&#160; Those are the facts
of the case, Doctor, and if they are of any use to
your collection, I am sure that they are very heartily
at your service.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Adventure V. The Musgrave Ritual</h1>

<p align="justify">An anomaly which often struck me in
the character of my friend Sherlock Holmes was that,
although in his methods of thought he was the neatest
and most methodical of mankind, and although also he
affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was
none the less in his personal habits one of the most
untidy men that ever drove a fellow-lodger to distraction.&#160;
Not that I am in the least conventional in that respect
myself.&#160; The rough-and-tumble work in Afghanistan,
coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition,
has made me rather more lax than befits a medical
man.&#160; But with me there is a limit, and when I
find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle,
his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and
his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife
into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then
I begin to give myself virtuous airs.&#160; I have
always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly
an open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his
queer humors, would sit in an arm-chair with his hair-trigger
and a hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn
the opposite wall with a patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks,
I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the
appearance of our room was improved by it.</p>

<p align="justify">Our chambers were always full of chemicals
and of criminal relics which had a way of wandering
into unlikely positions, and of turning up in the
butter-dish or in even less desirable places.&#160;
But his papers were my great crux.&#160; He had a horror
of destroying documents, especially those which were
connected with his past cases, and yet it was only
once in every year or two that he would muster energy
to docket and arrange them; for, as I have mentioned
somewhere in these incoherent memoirs, the outbursts
of passionate energy when he performed the remarkable
feats with which his name is associated were followed
by reactions of lethargy during which he would lie
about with his violin and his books, hardly moving
save from the sofa to the table.&#160; Thus month after
month his papers accumulated, until every corner of
the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which
were on no account to be burned, and which could not
be put away save by their owner.&#160; One winter&#8217;s
night, as we sat together by the fire, I ventured
to suggest to him that, as he had finished pasting
extracts into his common-place book, he might employ
the next two hours in making our room a little more
habitable.&#160; He could not deny the justice of my
request, so with a rather rueful face he went off
to his bedroom, from which he returned presently pulling
a large tin box behind him.&#160; This he placed in
the middle of the floor and, squatting down upon a
stool in front of it, he threw back the lid.&#160; I
could see that it was already a third full of bundles
of paper tied up with red tape into separate packages.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There are cases enough here,
Watson,&#8221; said he, looking at me with mischievous
eyes.&#160; &#8220;I think that if you knew all that
I had in this box you would ask me to pull some out
instead of putting others in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;These are the records of your
early work, then?&#8221; I asked.&#160; &#8220;I have
often wished that I had notes of those cases.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, my boy, these were all
done prematurely before my biographer had come to
glorify me.&#8221;&#160; He lifted bundle after bundle
in a tender, caressing sort of way.&#160; &#8220;They
are not all successes, Watson,&#8221; said he.&#160;
&#8220;But there are some pretty little problems among
them.&#160; Here&#8217;s the record of the Tarleton
murders, and the case of Vamberry, the wine merchant,
and the adventure of the old Russian woman, and the
singular affair of the aluminium crutch, as well as
a full account of Ricoletti of the club-foot, and
his abominable wife.&#160; And here&#8212;&#173;ah, now,
this really is something a little recherch&#233;.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He dived his arm down to the bottom
of the chest, and brought up a small wooden box with
a sliding lid, such as children&#8217;s toys are kept
in.&#160; From within he produced a crumpled piece
of paper, and old-fashioned brass key, a peg of wood
with a ball of string attached to it, and three rusty
old disks of metal.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, my boy, what do you make
of this lot?&#8221; he asked, smiling at my expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a curious collection.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;V&#233;ry curious, and the story
that hangs round it will strike you as being more
curious still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These relics have a history then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much so that they are history.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Sherlock Holmes picked them up one
by one, and laid them along the edge of the table.&#160;
Then he reseated himself in his chair and looked them
over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;These,&#8221; said he, &#8220;are
all that I have left to remind me of the adventure
of the Musgrave Ritual.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had heard him mention the case more
than once, though I had never been able to gather
the details.&#160; &#8220;I should be so glad,&#8221;
said I, &#8220;if you would give me an account of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And leave the litter as it
is?&#8221; he cried, mischievously.&#160; &#8220;Your
tidiness won&#8217;t bear much strain after all, Watson.&#160;
But I should be glad that you should add this case
to your annals, for there are points in it which make
it quite unique in the criminal records of this or,
I believe, of any other country.&#160; A collection
of my trifling achievements would certainly be incomplete
which contained no account of this very singular business.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You may remember how the affair
of the <i>Gloria Scott</i>, and my conversation with
the unhappy man whose fate I told you of, first turned
my attention in the direction of the profession which
has become my life&#8217;s work.&#160; You see me now
when my name has become known far and wide, and when
I am generally recognized both by the public and by
the official force as being a final court of appeal
in doubtful cases.&#160; Even when you knew me first,
at the time of the affair which you have commemorated
in &#8216;A Study in Scarlet,&#8217; I had already
established a considerable, though not a very lucrative,
connection.&#160; You can hardly realize, then, how
difficult I found it at first, and how long I had to
wait before I succeeded in making any headway.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;When I first came up to London
I had rooms in Montague Street, just round the corner
from the British Museum, and there I waited, filling
in my too abundant leisure time by studying all those
branches of science which might make me more efficient.&#160;
Now and again cases came in my way, principally through
the introduction of old fellow-students, for during
my last years at the University there was a good deal
of talk there about myself and my methods.&#160; The
third of these cases was that of the Musgrave Ritual,
and it is to the interest which was aroused by that
singular chain of events, and the large issues which
proved to be at stake, that I trace my first stride
towards the position which I now hold.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Reginald Musgrave had been
in the same college as myself, and I had some slight
acquaintance with him.&#160; He was not generally popular
among the undergraduates, though it always seemed
to me that what was set down as pride was really an
attempt to cover extreme natural diffidence.&#160;
In appearance he was a man of exceedingly aristocratic
type, thin, high-nosed, and large-eyed, with languid
and yet courtly manners.&#160; He was indeed a scion
of one of the very oldest families in the kingdom,
though his branch was a cadet one which had separated
from the northern Musgraves some time in the sixteenth
century, and had established itself in western Sussex,
where the Manor House of Hurlstone is perhaps the
oldest inhabited building in the county.&#160; Something
of his birth place seemed to cling to the man, and
I never looked at his pale, keen face or the poise
of his head without associating him with gray archways
and mullioned windows and all the venerable wreckage
of a feudal keep.&#160; Once or twice we drifted into
talk, and I can remember that more than once he expressed
a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;For four years I had seen nothing
of him until one morning he walked into my room in
Montague Street.&#160; He had changed little, was dressed
like a young man of fashion&#8212;&#173;he was always
a bit of a dandy&#8212;&#173;and preserved the same
quiet, suave manner which had formerly distinguished
him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;How has all gone with
you Musgrave?&#8217; I asked, after we had cordially
shaken hands.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You probably heard of
my poor father&#8217;s death,&#8217; said he; &#8217;he
was carried off about two years ago.&#160; Since then
I have of course had the Hurlstone estates to manage,
and as I am member for my district as well, my life
has been a busy one.&#160; But I understand, Holmes,
that you are turning to practical ends those powers
with which you used to amaze us?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I have taken
to living by my wits.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;I am delighted to hear
it, for your advice at present would be exceedingly
valuable to me.&#160; We have had some very strange
doings at Hurlstone, and the police have been able
to throw no light upon the matter.&#160; It is really
the most extraordinary and inexplicable business.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You can imagine with what eagerness
I listened to him, Watson, for the very chance for
which I had been panting during all those months of
inaction seemed to have come within my reach.&#160;
In my inmost heart I believed that I could succeed
where others failed, and now I had the opportunity
to test myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pray, let me have the details,&#8217;
I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Reginald Musgrave sat down
opposite to me, and lit the cigarette which I had
pushed towards him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You must know,&#8217;
said he, &#8217;that though I am a bachelor, I have
to keep up a considerable staff of servants at Hurlstone,
for it is a rambling old place, and takes a good deal
of looking after.&#160; I preserve, too, and in the
pheasant months I usually have a house-party, so that
it would not do to be short-handed.&#160; Altogether
there are eight maids, the cook, the butler, two footmen,
and a boy.&#160; The garden and the stables of course
have a separate staff.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Of these servants the
one who had been longest in our service was Brunton
the butler.&#160; He was a young school-master out of
place when he was first taken up by my father, but
he was a man of great energy and character, and he
soon became quite invaluable in the household.&#160;
He was a well-grown, handsome man, with a splendid
forehead, and though he has been with us for twenty
years he cannot be more than forty now.&#160; With
his personal advantages and his extraordinary gifts&#8212;&#173;for
he can speak several languages and play nearly every
musical instrument&#8212;&#173;it is wonderful that
he should have been satisfied so long in such a position,
but I suppose that he was comfortable, and lacked energy
to make any change.&#160; The butler of Hurlstone is
always a thing that is remembered by all who visit
us.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;But this paragon has
one fault.&#160; He is a bit of a Don Juan, and you
can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very
difficult part to play in a quiet country district.&#160;
When he was married it was all right, but since he
has been a widower we have had no end of trouble with
him.&#160; A few months ago we were in hopes that he
was about to settle down again for he became engaged
to Rachel Howells, our second house-maid; but he has
thrown her over since then and taken up with Janet
Tregellis, the daughter of the head game-keeper.&#160;
Rachel&#8212;&#173;who is a very good girl, but of
an excitable Welsh temperament&#8212;&#173;had a sharp
touch of brain-fever, and goes about the house now&#8212;&#173;or
did until yesterday&#8212;&#173;like a black-eyed shadow
of her former self.&#160; That was our first drama at
Hurlstone; but a second one came to drive it from
our minds, and it was prefaced by the disgrace and
dismissal of butler Brunton.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;This was how it came
about.&#160; I have said that the man was intelligent,
and this very intelligence has caused his ruin, for
it seems to have led to an insatiable curiosity about
things which did not in the least concern him.&#160;
I had no idea of the lengths to which this would carry
him, until the merest accident opened my eyes to it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;I have said that the
house is a rambling one.&#160; One day last week&#8212;&#173;on
Thursday night, to be more exact&#8212;&#173;I found
that I could not sleep, having foolishly taken a cup
of strong <i>caf&#233;</i> <i>noir</i> after my dinner.&#160;
After struggling against it until two in the morning,
I felt that it was quite hopeless, so I rose and lit
the candle with the intention of continuing a novel
which I was reading.&#160; The book, however, had been
left in the billiard-room, so I pulled on my dressing-gown
and started off to get it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;In order to reach the
billiard-room I had to descend a flight of stairs
and then to cross the head of a passage which led to
the library and the gun-room.&#160; You can imagine
my surprise when, as I looked down this corridor,
I saw a glimmer of light coming from the open door
of the library.&#160; I had myself extinguished the
lamp and closed the door before coming to bed.&#160;
Naturally my first thought was of burglars.&#160; The
corridors at Hurlstone have their walls largely decorated
with trophies of old weapons.&#160; From one of these
I picked a battle-axe, and then, leaving my candle
behind me, I crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped
in at the open door.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Brunton, the butler,
was in the library.&#160; He was sitting, fully dressed,
in an easy-chair, with a slip of paper which looked
like a map upon his knee, and his forehead sunk forward
upon his hand in deep thought.&#160; I stood dumb with
astonishment, watching him from the darkness.&#160;
A small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble
light which sufficed to show me that he was fully
dressed.&#160; Suddenly, as I looked, he rose from
his chair, and walking over to a bureau at the side,
he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers.&#160;
From this he took a paper, and returning to his seat
he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of
the table, and began to study it with minute attention.&#160;
My indignation at this calm examination of our family
documents overcame me so far that I took a step forward,
and Brunton, looking up, saw me standing in the doorway.&#160;
He sprang to his feet, his face turned livid with
fear, and he thrust into his breast the chart-like
paper which he had been originally studying.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"So!&#8221; said I.&#160;
&#8220;This is how you repay the trust which we have
reposed in you.&#160; You will leave my service to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;He bowed with the look
of a man who is utterly crushed, and slunk past me
without a word.&#160; The taper was still on the table,
and by its light I glanced to see what the paper was
which Brunton had taken from the bureau.&#160; To my
surprise it was nothing of any importance at all,
but simply a copy of the questions and answers in the
singular old observance called the Musgrave Ritual.&#160;
It is a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family, which
each Musgrave for centuries past has gone through
on his coming of age&#8212;&#173;a thing of private
interest, and perhaps of some little importance to
the archaeologist, like our own blazonings and charges,
but of no practical use whatever.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;We had better come back
to the paper afterwards,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;If you think it really
necessary,&#8217; he answered, with some hesitation.&#160;
&#8217;To continue my statement, however:&#160; I <i>relocked</i>
the bureau, using the key which Brunton had left,
and I had turned to go when I was surprised to find
that the butler had returned, and was standing before
me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"Mr. Musgrave, sir,&#8221;
he cried, in a voice which was hoarse with emotion,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear disgrace, sir.&#160; I&#8217;ve
always been proud above my station in life, and disgrace
would kill me.&#160; My blood will be on your head,
sir&#8212;&#173;it will, indeed&#8212;&#173;if you drive
me to despair.&#160; If you cannot keep me after what
has passed, then for God&#8217;s sake let me give you
notice and leave in a month, as if of my own free will.&#160;
I could stand that, Mr. Musgrave, but not to be cast
out before all the folk that I know so well.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"You don&#8217;t deserve
much consideration, Brunton,&#8221; I answered.&#160;
&#8220;Your conduct has been most infamous.&#160; However,
as you have been a long time in the family, I have
no wish to bring public disgrace upon you.&#160; A month,
however is too long.&#160; Take yourself away in a week,
and give what reason you like for going.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"Only a week, sir?&#8221;
he cried, in a despairing voice.&#160; &#8220;A fortnight&#8212;&#173;say
at least a fortnight!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"A week,&#8221; I repeated,
&#8220;and you may consider yourself to have been very
leniently dealt with.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;He crept away, his face
sunk upon his breast, like a broken man, while I put
out the light and returned to my room.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"For two days after
this Brunton was most assiduous in his attention to
his duties.&#160; I made no allusion to what had passed,
and waited with some curiosity to see how he would
cover his disgrace.&#160; On the third morning, however
he did not appear, as was his custom, after breakfast
to receive my instructions for the day.&#160; As I left
the dining-room I happened to meet Rachel Howells,
the maid.&#160; I have told you that she had only recently
recovered from an illness, and was looking so wretchedly
pale and wan that I remonstrated with her for being
at work.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"You should be in bed,&#8221;
I said.&#160; &#8220;Come back to your duties when you
are stronger.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;She looked at me with
so strange an expression that I began to suspect that
her brain was affected.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"I am strong enough, Mr. Musgrave,&#8221;
said she.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"We will see what the
doctor says,&#8221; I answered.&#160; &#8220;You must
stop work now, and when you go downstairs just say
that I wish to see Brunton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"The butler is gone,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;"Gone!&#160; Gone where?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"He is gone.&#160; No
one has seen him.&#160; He is not in his room.&#160;
Oh, yes, he is gone, he is gone!&#8221; She fell back
against the wall with shriek after shriek of laughter,
while I, horrified at this sudden hysterical attack,
rushed to the bell to summon help.&#160; The girl was
taken to her room, still screaming and sobbing, while
I made inquiries about Brunton.&#160; There was no
doubt about it that he had disappeared.&#160; His bed
had not been slept in, he had been seen by no one
since he had retired to his room the night before,
and yet it was difficult to see how he could have left
the house, as both windows and doors were found to
be fastened in the morning.&#160; His clothes, his
watch, and even his money were in his room, but the
black suit which he usually wore was missing.&#160;
His slippers, too, were gone, but his boots were left
behind.&#160; Where then could butler Brunton have
gone in the night, and what could have become of him
now?</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Of course we searched
the house from cellar to garret, but there was no
trace of him.&#160; It is, as I have said, a labyrinth
of an old house, especially the original wing, which
is now practically uninhabited; but we ransacked every
room and cellar without discovering the least sign
of the missing man.&#160; It was incredible to me that
he could have gone away leaving all his property behind
him, and yet where could he be?&#160; I called in the
local police, but without success.&#160; Rain had fallen
on the night before and we examined the lawn and the
paths all round the house, but in vain.&#160; Matters
were in this state, when a new development quite drew
our attention away from the original mystery.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;For two days Rachel
Howells had been so ill, sometimes delirious, sometimes
hysterical, that a nurse had been employed to sit up
with her at night.&#160; On the third night after Brunton&#8217;s
disappearance, the nurse, finding her patient sleeping
nicely, had dropped into a nap in the arm-chair, when
she woke in the early morning to find the bed empty,
the window open, and no signs of the invalid.&#160;
I was instantly aroused, and, with the two footmen,
started off at once in search of the missing girl.&#160;
It was not difficult to tell the direction which she
had taken, for, starting from under her window, we
could follow her footmarks easily across the lawn
to the edge of the mere, where they vanished close
to the gravel path which leads out of the grounds.&#160;
The lake there is eight feet deep, and you can imagine
our feelings when we saw that the trail of the poor
demented girl came to an end at the edge of it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Of course, we had the
drags at once, and set to work to recover the remains,
but no trace of the body could we find.&#160; On the
other hand, we brought to the surface an object of
a most unexpected kind.&#160; It was a linen bag which
contained within it a mass of old rusted and discolored
metal and several dull-colored pieces of pebble or
glass.&#160; This strange find was all that we could
get from the mere, and, although we made every possible
search and inquiry yesterday, we know nothing of the
fate either of Rachel Howells or of Richard Brunton.&#160;
The county police are at their wits&#8217; end, and
I have come up to you as a last resource.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You can imagine, Watson, with
what eagerness I listened to this extraordinary sequence
of events, and endeavored to piece them together,
and to devise some common thread upon which they might
all hang.&#160; The butler was gone.&#160; The maid
was gone.&#160; The maid had loved the butler, but
had afterwards had cause to hate him.&#160; She was
of Welsh blood, fiery and passionate.&#160; She had
been terribly excited immediately after his disappearance.&#160;
She had flung into the lake a bag containing some
curious contents.&#160; These were all factors which
had to be taken into consideration, and yet none of
them got quite to the heart of the matter.&#160; What
was the starting-point of this chain of events?&#160;
There lay the end of this tangled line.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I must see that paper,
Musgrave,&#8217; said I, &#8217;which this butler of
your thought it worth his while to consult, even at
the risk of the loss of his place.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;It is rather an absurd
business, this ritual of ours,&#8217; he answered.&#160;
&#8217;But it has at least the saving grace of antiquity
to excuse it.&#160; I have a copy of the questions
and answers here if you care to run your eye over
them.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He handed me the very paper
which I have here, Watson, and this is the strange
catechism to which each Musgrave had to submit when
he came to man&#8217;s estate.&#160; I will read you
the questions and answers as they stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Whose was it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;His who is gone.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Who shall have it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He who will come.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where was the sun?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Over the oak.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where was the shadow?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Under the elm.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was it stepped?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;North by ten and by
ten, east by five and by five, south by two and by
two, west by one and by one, and so under.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What shall we give for it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;All that is ours.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why should we give it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;For the sake of the trust.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;The original has no
date, but is in the spelling of the middle of the
seventeenth century,&#8217; remarked Musgrave.&#160;
&#8217;I am afraid, however, that it can be of little
help to you in solving this mystery.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;At least,&#8217; said
I, &#8217;it gives us another mystery, and one which
is even more interesting than the first.&#160; It may
be that the solution of the one may prove to be the
solution of the other.&#160; You will excuse me, Musgrave,
if I say that your butler appears to me to have been
a very clever man, and to have had a clearer insight
than ten generations of his masters.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I hardly follow you,&#8217;
said Musgrave.&#160; &#8217;The paper seems to me to
be of no practical importance.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;But to me it seems immensely
practical, and I fancy that Brunton took the same
view.&#160; He had probably seen it before that night
on which you caught him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is very possible.&#160; We took no
pains to hide it.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;He simply wished, I
should imagine, to refresh his memory upon that last
occasion.&#160; He had, as I understand, some sort of
map or chart which he was comparing with the manuscript,
and which he thrust into his pocket when you appeared.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;That is true.&#160; But
what could he have to do with this old family custom
of ours, and what does this rigmarole mean?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;I don&#8217;t think
that we should have much difficulty in determining
that,&#8217; said I; &#8217;with your permission we
will take the first train down to Sussex, and go a
little more deeply into the matter upon the spot.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The same afternoon saw us both
at Hurlstone.&#160; Possibly you have seen pictures
and read descriptions of the famous old building, so
I will confine my account of it to saying that it
is built in the shape of an L, the long arm being
the more modern portion, and the shorter the ancient
nucleus, from which the other had developed.&#160; Over
the low, heavily-lintelled door, in the centre of
this old part, is chiseled the date, 1607, but experts
are agreed that the beams and stone-work are really
much older than this.&#160; The enormously thick walls
and tiny windows of this part had in the last century
driven the family into building the new wing, and
the old one was used now as a store-house and a cellar,
when it was used at all.&#160; A splendid park with
fine old timber surrounds the house, and the lake,
to which my client had referred, lay close to the
avenue, about two hundred yards from the building.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I was already firmly convinced,
Watson, that there were not three separate mysteries
here, but one only, and that if I could read the Musgrave
Ritual aright I should hold in my hand the clue which
would lead me to the truth concerning both the butler
Brunton and the maid Howells.&#160; To that then I
turned all my energies.&#160; Why should this servant
be so anxious to master this old formula?&#160; Evidently
because he saw something in it which had escaped all
those generations of country squires, and from which
he expected some personal advantage.&#160; What was
it then, and how had it affected his fate?</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was perfectly obvious to
me, on reading the ritual, that the measurements must
refer to some spot to which the rest of the document
alluded, and that if we could find that spot, we should
be in a fair way towards finding what the secret was
which the old Musgraves had thought it necessary to
embalm in so curious a fashion.&#160; There were two
guides given us to start with, an oak and an elm.&#160;
As to the oak there could be no question at all.&#160;
Right in front of the house, upon the left-hand side
of the drive, there stood a patriarch among oaks, one
of the most magnificent trees that I have ever seen.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;That was there when
your ritual was drawn up,&#8217; said I, as we drove
past it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;It was there at the
Norman Conquest in all probability,&#8217; he answered.&#160;
&#8216;It has a girth of twenty-three feet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Have you any old elms?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;There used to be a very
old one over yonder but it was struck by lightning
ten years ago, and we cut down the stump.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You can see where it used to be?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There are no other elms?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No old ones, but plenty of beeches.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I should like to see where it grew.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We had driven up in a dog-cart,
and my client led me away at once, without our entering
the house, to the scar on the lawn where the elm had
stood.&#160; It was nearly midway between the oak and
the house.&#160; My investigation seemed to be progressing.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I suppose it is impossible to find out
how high the elm was?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can give you it at once.&#160; It was
sixty-four feet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How do you come to know it?&#8217; I
asked, in surprise.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;When my old tutor used
to give me an exercise in trigonometry, it always
took the shape of measuring heights.&#160; When I was
a lad I worked out every tree and building in the
estate.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This was an unexpected piece
of luck.&#160; My data were coming more quickly than
I could have reasonably hoped.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tell me,&#8217; I asked, &#8216;did
your butler ever ask you such a question?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Reginald Musgrave looked at
me in astonishment.&#160; &#8217;Now that you call it
to my mind,&#8217; he answered, &#8217;Brunton did
ask me about the height of the tree some months ago,
in connection with some little argument with the groom.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This was excellent news, Watson,
for it showed me that I was on the right road.&#160;
I looked up at the sun.&#160; It was low in the heavens,
and I calculated that in less than an hour it would
lie just above the topmost branches of the old oak.&#160;
One condition mentioned in the Ritual would then be
fulfilled.&#160; And the shadow of the elm must mean
the farther end of the shadow, otherwise the trunk
would have been chosen as the guide.&#160; I had, then,
to find where the far end of the shadow would fall
when the sun was just clear of the oak.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That must have been difficult,
Holmes, when the elm was no longer there.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, at least I knew that
if Brunton could do it, I could also.&#160; Besides,
there was no real difficulty.&#160; I went with Musgrave
to his study and whittled myself this peg, to which
I tied this long string with a knot at each yard.&#160;
Then I took two lengths of a fishing-rod, which came
to just six feet, and I went back with my client to
where the elm had been.&#160; The sun was just grazing
the top of the oak.&#160; I fastened the rod on end,
marked out the direction of the shadow, and measured
it.&#160; It was nine feet in length.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Of course the calculation now
was a simple one.&#160; If a rod of six feet threw
a shadow of nine, a tree of sixty-four feet would throw
one of ninety-six, and the line of the one would of
course be the line of the other.&#160; I measured out
the distance, which brought me almost to the wall
of the house, and I thrust a peg into the spot.&#160;
You can imagine my exultation, Watson, when within
two inches of my peg I saw a conical depression in
the ground.&#160; I knew that it was the mark made by
Brunton in his measurements, and that I was still
upon his trail.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;From this starting-point I
proceeded to step, having first taken the cardinal
points by my pocket-compass.&#160; Ten steps with each
foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house,
and again I marked my spot with a peg.&#160; Then I
carefully paced off five to the east and two to the
south.&#160; It brought me to the very threshold of
the old door.&#160; Two steps to the west meant now
that I was to go two paces down the stone-flagged
passage, and this was the place indicated by the Ritual.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Never have I felt such a cold
chill of disappointment, Watson.&#160; For a moment
is seemed to me that there must be some radical mistake
in my calculations.&#160; The setting sun shone full
upon the passage floor, and I could see that the old,
foot-worn gray stones with which it was paved were
firmly cemented together, and had certainly not been
moved for many a long year.&#160; Brunton had not been
at work here.&#160; I tapped upon the floor, but it
sounded the same all over, and there was no sign of
any crack or crevice.&#160; But, fortunately, Musgrave,
who had begun to appreciate the meaning of my proceedings,
and who was now as excited as myself, took out his
manuscript to check my calculation.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;And under,&#8217; he
cried.&#160; &#8216;You have omitted the &#8220;and
under."&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I had thought that it meant
that we were to dig, but now, of course, I saw at
once that I was wrong.&#160; &#8216;There is a cellar
under this then?&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Yes, and as old as the
house.&#160; Down here, through this door.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We went down a winding stone
stair, and my companion, striking a match, lit a large
lantern which stood on a barrel in the corner.&#160;
In an instant it was obvious that we had at last come
upon the true place, and that we had not been the
only people to visit the spot recently.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It had been used for the storage
of wood, but the billets, which had evidently been
littered over the floor, were now piled at the sides,
so as to leave a clear space in the middle.&#160; In
this space lay a large and heavy flagstone with a
rusted iron ring in the centre to which a thick shepherd&#8217;s-check
muffler was attached.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;By Jove!&#8217; cried
my client.&#160; &#8217;That&#8217;s Brunton&#8217;s
muffler.&#160; I have seen it on him, and could swear
to it.&#160; What has the villain been doing here?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;At my suggestion a couple of
the county police were summoned to be present, and
I then endeavored to raise the stone by pulling on
the cravat.&#160; I could only move it slightly, and
it was with the aid of one of the constables that
I succeeded at last in carrying it to one side.&#160;
A black hole yawned beneath into which we all peered,
while Musgrave, kneeling at the side, pushed down
the lantern.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A small chamber about seven
feet deep and four feet square lay open to us.&#160;
At one side of this was a squat, brass-bound wooden
box, the lid of which was hinged upwards, with this
curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock.&#160;
It was furred outside by a thick layer of dust, and
damp and worms had eaten through the wood, so that
a crop of livid fungi was growing on the inside of
it.&#160; Several discs of metal, old coins apparently,
such as I hold here, were scattered over the bottom
of the box, but it contained nothing else.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;At the moment, however, we
had no thought for the old chest, for our eyes were
riveted upon that which crouched beside it.&#160; It
was the figure of a man, clad in a suit of black,
who squatted down upon his hams with his forehead
sunk upon the edge of the box and his two arms thrown
out on each side of it.&#160; The attitude had drawn
all the stagnant blood to the face, and no man could
have recognized that distorted liver-colored countenance;
but his height, his dress, and his hair were all sufficient
to show my client, when we had drawn the body up, that
it was indeed his missing butler.&#160; He had been
dead some days, but there was no wound or bruise upon
his person to show how he had met his dreadful end.&#160;
When his body had been carried from the cellar we
found ourselves still confronted with a problem which
was almost as formidable as that with which we had
started.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I confess that so far, Watson,
I had been disappointed in my investigation.&#160;
I had reckoned upon solving the matter when once I
had found the place referred to in the Ritual; but
now I was there, and was apparently as far as ever
from knowing what it was which the family had concealed
with such elaborate precautions.&#160; It is true that
I had thrown a light upon the fate of Brunton, but
now I had to ascertain how that fate had come upon
him, and what part had been played in the matter by
the woman who had disappeared.&#160; I sat down upon
a keg in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully
over.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You know my methods in such
cases, Watson.&#160; I put myself in the man&#8217;s
place and, having first gauged his intelligence, I
try to imagine how I should myself have proceeded
under the same circumstances.&#160; In this case the
matter was simplified by Brunton&#8217;s intelligence
being quite first-rate, so that it was unnecessary
to make any allowance for the personal equation, as
the astronomers have dubbed it.&#160; He knew that
something valuable was concealed.&#160; He had spotted
the place.&#160; He found that the stone which covered
it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided.&#160;
What would he do next?&#160; He could not get help from
outside, even if he had some one whom he could trust,
without the unbarring of doors and considerable risk
of detection.&#160; It was better, if he could, to have
his helpmate inside the house.&#160; But whom could
he ask?&#160; This girl had been devoted to him.&#160;
A man always finds it hard to realize that he may have
finally lost a woman&#8217;s love, however badly he
may have treated her.&#160; He would try by a few attentions
to make his peace with the girl Howells, and then
would engage her as his accomplice.&#160; Together they
would come at night to the cellar, and their united
force would suffice to raise the stone.&#160; So far
I could follow their actions as if I had actually seen
them.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But for two of them, and one
a woman, it must have been heavy work the raising
of that stone.&#160; A burly Sussex policeman and I
had found it no light job.&#160; What would they do
to assist them?&#160; Probably what I should have done
myself.&#160; I rose and examined carefully the different
billets of wood which were scattered round the floor.&#160;
Almost at once I came upon what I expected.&#160; One
piece, about three feet in length, had a very marked
indentation at one end, while several were flattened
at the sides as if they had been compressed by some
considerable weight.&#160; Evidently, as they had dragged
the stone up they had thrust the chunks of wood into
the chink, until at last, when the opening was large
enough to crawl through, they would hold it open by
a billet placed lengthwise, which might very well
become indented at the lower end, since the whole weight
of the stone would press it down on to the edge of
this other slab.&#160; So far I was still on safe ground.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And now how was I to proceed
to reconstruct this midnight drama?&#160; Clearly,
only one could fit into the hole, and that one was
Brunton.&#160; The girl must have waited above.&#160;
Brunton then unlocked the box, handed up the contents
presumably&#8212;&#173;since they were not to be found&#8212;&#173;and
then&#8212;&#173;and then what happened?</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What smouldering fire of vengeance
had suddenly sprung into flame in this passionate
Celtic woman&#8217;s soul when she saw the man who
had wronged her&#8212;&#173;wronged her, perhaps, far
more than we suspected&#8212;&#173;in her power?&#160;
Was it a chance that the wood had slipped, and that
the stone had shut Brunton into what had become his
sepulchre?&#160; Had she only been guilty of silence
as to his fate?&#160; Or had some sudden blow from her
hand dashed the support away and sent the slab crashing
down into its place?&#160; Be that as it might, I seemed
to see that woman&#8217;s figure still clutching at
her treasure trove and flying wildly up the winding
stair, with her ears ringing perhaps with the muffled
screams from behind her and with the drumming of frenzied
hands against the slab of stone which was choking
her faithless lover&#8217;s life out.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Here was the secret of her
blanched face, her shaken nerves, her peals of hysterical
laughter on the next morning.&#160; But what had been
in the box?&#160; What had she done with that?&#160;
Of course, it must have been the old metal and pebbles
which my client had dragged from the mere.&#160; She
had thrown them in there at the first opportunity
to remove the last trace of her crime.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;For twenty minutes I had sat
motionless, thinking the matter out.&#160; Musgrave
still stood with a very pale face, swinging his lantern
and peering down into the hole.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;These are coins of Charles
the First,&#8217; said he, holding out the few which
had been in the box; &#8217;you see we were right in
fixing our date for the Ritual.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;We may find something
else of Charles the First,&#8217; I cried, as the
probable meaning of the first two questions of the
Ritual broke suddenly upon me.&#160; &#8217;Let me
see the contents of the bag which you fished from the
mere.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We ascended to his study, and
he laid the debris before me.&#160; I could understand
his regarding it as of small importance when I looked
at it, for the metal was almost black and the stones
lustreless and dull.&#160; I rubbed one of them on
my sleeve, however, and it glowed afterwards like
a spark in the dark hollow of my hand.&#160; The metal
work was in the form of a double ring, but it had
been bent and twisted out of its original shape.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You must bear in mind,&#8217;
said I, &#8217;that the royal party made head in England
even after the death of the king, and that when they
at last fled they probably left many of their most
precious possessions buried behind them, with the
intention of returning for them in more peaceful times.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;My ancestor, Sir Ralph
Musgrave, was a prominent Cavalier and the right-hand
man of Charles the Second in his wanderings,&#8217;
said my friend.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Ah, indeed!&#8217; I
answered.&#160; &#8217;Well now, I think that really
should give us the last link that we wanted.&#160;
I must congratulate you on coming into the possession,
though in rather a tragic manner of a relic which is
of great intrinsic value, but of even greater importance
as an historical curiosity.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What is it, then?&#8217; he gasped in
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is nothing less than the ancient
crown of the kings of England.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The crown!&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Precisely.&#160; Consider
what the Ritual says:&#160; How does it run?&#160; &#8220;Whose
was it?&#8221; &#8220;His who is gone.&#8221;&#160;
That was after the execution of Charles.&#160; Then,
&#8220;Who shall have it?&#8221; &#8220;He who will
come.&#8221;&#160; That was Charles the Second, whose
advent was already foreseen.&#160; There can, I think,
be no doubt that this battered and shapeless diadem
once encircled the brows of the royal Stuarts.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And how came it in the pond?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Ah, that is a question
that will take some time to answer.&#8217;&#160; And
with that I sketched out to him the whole long chain
of surmise and of proof which I had constructed.&#160;
The twilight had closed in and the moon was shining
brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;And how was it then
that Charles did not get his crown when he returned?&#8217;
asked Musgrave, pushing back the relic into its linen
bag.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Ah, there you lay your
finger upon the one point which we shall probably
never be able to clear up.&#160; It is likely that the
Musgrave who held the secret died in the interval,
and by some oversight left this guide to his descendant
without explaining the meaning of it.&#160; From that
day to this it has been handed down from father to
son, until at last it came within reach of a man who
tore its secret out of it and lost his life in the
venture.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And that&#8217;s the story
of the Musgrave Ritual, Watson.&#160; They have the
crown down at Hurlstone&#8212;&#173;though they had
some legal bother and a considerable sum to pay before
they were allowed to retain it.&#160; I am sure that
if you mentioned my name they would be happy to show
it to you.&#160; Of the woman nothing was ever heard,
and the probability is that she got away out of England
and carried herself and the memory of her crime to
some land beyond the seas.&#8221;</p>

<mbp:pagebreak />
<h1>Adventure VI.&#160; The Reigate Puzzle</h1>

<p align="justify">It was some time before the health
of my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes recovered from the
strain caused by his immense exertions in the spring
of &#8217;87.&#160; The whole question of the Netherland-Sumatra
Company and of the colossal schemes of Baron Maupertuis
are too recent in the minds of the public, and are
too intimately concerned with politics and finance
to be fitting subjects for this series of sketches.&#160;
They led, however, in an indirect fashion to a singular
and complex problem which gave my friend an opportunity
of demonstrating the value of a fresh weapon among
the many with which he waged his life-long battle
against crime.</p>

<p align="justify">On referring to my notes I see that
it was upon the 14th of April that I received a telegram
from Lyons which informed me that Holmes was lying
ill in the Hotel Dulong.&#160; Within twenty-four hours
I was in his sick-room, and was relieved to find that
there was nothing formidable in his symptoms.&#160;
Even his iron constitution, however, had broken down
under the strain of an investigation which had extended
over two months, during which period he had never
worked less than fifteen hours a day, and had more
than once, as he assured me, kept to his task for five
days at a stretch.&#160; Even the triumphant issue
of his labors could not save him from reaction after
so terrible an exertion, and at a time when Europe
was ringing with his name and when his room was literally
ankle-deep with congratulatory telegrams I found him
a prey to the blackest depression.&#160; Even the knowledge
that he had succeeded where the police of three countries
had failed, and that he had outmanoeuvred at every
point the most accomplished swindler in Europe, was
insufficient to rouse him from his nervous prostration.</p>

<p align="justify">Three days later we were back in Baker
Street together; but it was evident that my friend
would be much the better for a change, and the thought
of a week of spring time in the country was full of
attractions to me also.&#160; My old friend, Colonel
Hayter, who had come under my professional care in
Afghanistan, had now taken a house near Reigate in
Surrey, and had frequently asked me to come down to
him upon a visit.&#160; On the last occasion he had
remarked that if my friend would only come with me
he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also.&#160;
A little diplomacy was needed, but when Holmes understood
that the establishment was a bachelor one, and that
he would be allowed the fullest freedom, he fell in
with my plans and a week after our return from Lyons
we were under the Colonel&#8217;s roof.&#160; Hayter
was a fine old soldier who had seen much of the world,
and he soon found, as I had expected, that Holmes and
he had much in common.</p>

<p align="justify">On the evening of our arrival we were
sitting in the Colonel&#8217;s gun-room after dinner,
Holmes stretched upon the sofa, while Hayter and I
looked over his little armory of Eastern weapons.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said he
suddenly, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll take one of these
pistols upstairs with me in case we have an alarm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An alarm!&#8221; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ve had a scare
in this part lately.&#160; Old Acton, who is one of
our county magnates, had his house broken into last
Monday.&#160; No great damage done, but the fellows
are still at large.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No clue?&#8221; asked Holmes, cocking his eye
at the Colonel.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;None as yet.&#160; But the affair
is a petty one, one of our little country crimes,
which must seem too small for your attention, Mr. Holmes,
after this great international affair.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes waved away the compliment,
though his smile showed that it had pleased him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there any feature of interest?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I fancy not.&#160; The thieves
ransacked the library and got very little for their
pains.&#160; The whole place was turned upside down,
drawers burst open, and presses ransacked, with the
result that an odd volume of Pope&#8217;s &#8216;Homer,&#8217;
two plated candlesticks, an ivory letter-weight, a
small oak barometer, and a ball of twine are all that
have vanished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What an extraordinary assortment!&#8221; I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the fellows evidently grabbed hold of everything
they could get.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes grunted from the sofa.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The county police ought to
make something of that,&#8221; said he; &#8220;why,
it is surely obvious that&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>But I held up a warning finger.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are here for a rest, my
dear fellow.&#160; For Heaven&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t
get started on a new problem when your nerves are
all in shreds.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes shrugged his shoulders with
a glance of comic resignation towards the Colonel,
and the talk drifted away into less dangerous channels.</p>

<p align="justify">It was destined, however, that all
my professional caution should be wasted, for next
morning the problem obtruded itself upon us in such
a way that it was impossible to ignore it, and our
country visit took a turn which neither of us could
have anticipated.&#160; We were at breakfast when the
Colonel&#8217;s butler rushed in with all his propriety
shaken out of him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Have you heard the news, sir?&#8221;
he gasped.&#160; &#8220;At the Cunningham&#8217;s sir!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Burglary!&#8221; cried the
Colonel, with his coffee-cup in mid-air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Murder!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The Colonel whistled.&#160; &#8220;By
Jove!&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;Who&#8217;s killed,
then?&#160; The J.P. or his son?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Neither, sir.&#160; It was William
the coachman.&#160; Shot through the heart, sir, and
never spoke again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who shot him, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The burglar, sir.&#160; He was
off like a shot and got clean away.&#160; He&#8217;d
just broke in at the pantry window when William came
on him and met his end in saving his master&#8217;s
property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was last night, sir, somewhere about twelve.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, then, we&#8217;ll step
over afterwards,&#8221; said the Colonel, coolly settling
down to his breakfast again.&#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s
a baddish business,&#8221; he added when the butler
had gone; &#8220;he&#8217;s our leading man about here,
is old Cunningham, and a very decent fellow too.&#160;
He&#8217;ll be cut up over this, for the man has been
in his service for years and was a good servant.&#160;
It&#8217;s evidently the same villains who broke into
Acton&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And stole that very singular collection,&#8221;
said Holmes, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Hum!&#160; It may prove the
simplest matter in the world, but all the same at
first glance this is just a little curious, is it not?&#160;
A gang of burglars acting in the country might be
expected to vary the scene of their operations, and
not to crack two cribs in the same district within
a few days.&#160; When you spoke last night of taking
precautions I remember that it passed through my mind
that this was probably the last parish in England
to which the thief or thieves would be likely to turn
their attention&#8212;&#173;which shows that I have
still much to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I fancy it&#8217;s some local
practitioner,&#8221; said the Colonel.&#160; &#8220;In
that case, of course, Acton&#8217;s and Cunningham&#8217;s
are just the places he would go for, since they are
far the largest about here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And richest?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, they ought to be, but
they&#8217;ve had a lawsuit for some years which has
sucked the blood out of both of them, I fancy.&#160;
Old Acton has some claim on half Cunningham&#8217;s
estate, and the lawyers have been at it with both
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If it&#8217;s a local villain
there should not be much difficulty in running him
down,&#8221; said Holmes with a yawn.&#160; &#8220;All
right, Watson, I don&#8217;t intend to meddle.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Inspector Forrester, sir,&#8221;
said the butler, throwing open the door.</p>

<p align="justify">The official, a smart, keen-faced
young fellow, stepped into the room.&#160; &#8220;Good-morning,
Colonel,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I hope I don&#8217;t
intrude, but we hear that Mr. Holmes of Baker Street
is here.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The Colonel waved his hand towards
my friend, and the Inspector bowed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We thought that perhaps you
would care to step across, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The fates are against you,
Watson,&#8221; said he, laughing.&#160; &#8220;We were
chatting about the matter when you came in, Inspector.&#160;
Perhaps you can let us have a few details.&#8221;&#160;
As he leaned back in his chair in the familiar attitude
I knew that the case was hopeless.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We had no clue in the Acton
affair.&#160; But here we have plenty to go on, and
there&#8217;s no doubt it is the same party in each
case.&#160; The man was seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, sir.&#160; But he was off
like a deer after the shot that killed poor William
Kirwan was fired.&#160; Mr. Cunningham saw him from
the bedroom window, and Mr. Alec Cunningham saw him
from the back passage.&#160; It was quarter to twelve
when the alarm broke out.&#160; Mr. Cunningham had just
got into bed, and Mr. Alec was smoking a pipe in his
dressing-gown.&#160; They both heard William the coachman
calling for help, and Mr. Alec ran down to see what
was the matter.&#160; The back door was open, and as
he came to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestling
together outside.&#160; One of them fired a shot, the
other dropped, and the murderer rushed across the
garden and over the hedge.&#160; Mr. Cunningham, looking
out of his bedroom, saw the fellow as he gained the
road, but lost sight of him at once.&#160; Mr. Alec
stopped to see if he could help the dying man, and
so the villain got clean away.&#160; Beyond the fact
that he was a middle-sized man and dressed in some
dark stuff, we have no personal clue; but we are making
energetic inquiries, and if he is a stranger we shall
soon find him out.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What was this William doing
there?&#160; Did he say anything before he died?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not a word.&#160; He lives at
the lodge with his mother, and as he was a very faithful
fellow we imagine that he walked up to the house with
the intention of seeing that all was right there.&#160;
Of course this Acton business has put every one on
their guard.&#160; The robber must have just burst
open the door&#8212;&#173;the lock has been forced&#8212;&#173;when
William came upon him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Did William say anything to
his mother before going out?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She is very old and deaf, and
we can get no information from her.&#160; The shock
has made her half-witted, but I understand that she
was never very bright.&#160; There is one very important
circumstance, however.&#160; Look at this!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He took a small piece of torn paper
from a note-book and spread it out upon his knee.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This was found between the
finger and thumb of the dead man.&#160; It appears
to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet.&#160; You
will observe that the hour mentioned upon it is the
very time at which the poor fellow met his fate.&#160;
You see that his murderer might have torn the rest
of the sheet from him or he might have taken this
fragment from the murderer.&#160; It reads almost as
though it were an appointment.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes took up the scrap of paper,
a fac-simile of which is here reproduced.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;d at quarter to twelve
learn what maybe</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Presuming that it is an appointment,&#8221;
continued the Inspector, &#8220;it is of course a
conceivable theory that this William Kirwan&#8212;&#173;though
he had the reputation of being an honest man, may
have been in league with the thief.&#160; He may have
met him there, may even have helped him to break in
the door, and then they may have fallen out between
themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This writing is of extraordinary
interest,&#8221; said Holmes, who had been examining
it with intense concentration.&#160; &#8220;These are
much deeper waters than I had though.&#8221;&#160;
He sank his head upon his hands, while the Inspector
smiled at the effect which his case had had upon the
famous London specialist.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your last remark,&#8221; said
Holmes, presently, &#8220;as to the possibility of
there being an understanding between the burglar and
the servant, and this being a note of appointment
from one to the other, is an ingenious and not entirely
impossible supposition.&#160; But this writing opens
up&#8212;&#173;&#8221; He sank his head into his hands
again and remained for some minutes in the deepest
thought.&#160; When he raised his face again, I was
surprised to see that his cheek was tinged with color,
and his eyes as bright as before his illness.&#160;
He sprang to his feet with all his old energy.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I should like to have a quiet little
glance into the details of this case.&#160; There is
something in it which fascinates me extremely.&#160;
If you will permit me, Colonel, I will leave my friend
Watson and you, and I will step round with the Inspector
to test the truth of one or two little fancies of
mine.&#160; I will be with you again in half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">An hour and half had elapsed before
the Inspector returned alone.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mr. Holmes is walking up and
down in the field outside,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;He
wants us all four to go up to the house together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Mr. Cunningham&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The Inspector shrugged his shoulders.&#160;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know, sir.&#160; Between
ourselves, I think Mr. Holmes had not quite got over
his illness yet.&#160; He&#8217;s been behaving very
queerly, and he is very much excited.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you need
alarm yourself,&#8221; said I.&#160; &#8220;I have usually
found that there was method in his madness.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Some folks might say there
was madness in his method,&#8221; muttered the Inspector.&#160;
&#8220;But he&#8217;s all on fire to start, Colonel,
so we had best go out if you are ready.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We found Holmes pacing up and down
in the field, his chin sunk upon his breast, and his
hands thrust into his trousers pockets.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The matter grows in interest,&#8221;
said he.&#160; &#8220;Watson, your country-trip has
been a distinct success.&#160; I have had a charming
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You have been up to the scene
of the crime, I understand,&#8221; said the Colonel.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes; the Inspector and I have
made quite a little reconnaissance together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any success?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, we have seen some very
interesting things.&#160; I&#8217;ll tell you what we
did as we walk.&#160; First of all, we saw the body
of this unfortunate man.&#160; He certainly died from
a revolver wound as reported.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you doubted it, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, it is as well to test everything.&#160;
Our inspection was not wasted.&#160; We then had an
interview with Mr. Cunningham and his son, who were
able to point out the exact spot where the murderer
had broken through the garden-hedge in his flight.&#160;
That was of great interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then we had a look at this
poor fellow&#8217;s mother.&#160; We could get no information
from her, however, as she is very old and feeble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is the result of your investigations?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The conviction that the crime
is a very peculiar one.&#160; Perhaps our visit now
may do something to make it less obscure.&#160; I think
that we are both agreed, Inspector that the fragment
of paper in the dead man&#8217;s hand, bearing, as
it does, the very hour of his death written upon it,
is of extreme importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It should give a clue, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It does give a clue.&#160; Whoever
wrote that note was the man who brought William Kirwan
out of his bed at that hour.&#160; But where is the
rest of that sheet of paper?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I examined the ground carefully
in the hope of finding it,&#8221; said the Inspector.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was torn out of the dead
man&#8217;s hand.&#160; Why was some one so anxious
to get possession of it?&#160; Because it incriminated
him.&#160; And what would he do with it?&#160; Thrust
it into his pocket, most likely, never noticing that
a corner of it had been left in the grip of the corpse.&#160;
If we could get the rest of that sheet it is obvious
that we should have gone a long way towards solving
the mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, but how can we get at
the criminal&#8217;s pocket before we catch the criminal?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, well, it was worth thinking
over.&#160; Then there is another obvious point.&#160;
The note was sent to William.&#160; The man who wrote
it could not have taken it; otherwise, of course,
he might have delivered his own message by word of
mouth.&#160; Who brought the note, then?&#160; Or did
it come through the post?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have made inquiries,&#8221;
said the Inspector.&#160; &#8220;William received a
letter by the afternoon post yesterday.&#160; The envelope
was destroyed by him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; cried Holmes,
clapping the Inspector on the back.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;ve
seen the postman.&#160; It is a pleasure to work with
you.&#160; Well, here is the lodge, and if you will
come up, Colonel, I will show you the scene of the
crime.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We passed the pretty cottage where
the murdered man had lived, and walked up an oak-lined
avenue to the fine old Queen Anne house, which bears
the date of Malplaquet upon the lintel of the door.&#160;
Holmes and the Inspector led us round it until we
came to the side gate, which is separated by a stretch
of garden from the hedge which lines the road.&#160;
A constable was standing at the kitchen door.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Throw the door open, officer,&#8221;
said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;Now, it was on those stairs
that young Mr. Cunningham stood and saw the two men
struggling just where we are.&#160; Old Mr. Cunningham
was at that window&#8212;&#173;the second on the left&#8212;&#173;and
he saw the fellow get away just to the left of that
bush.&#160; Then Mr. Alec ran out and knelt beside
the wounded man.&#160; The ground is very hard, you
see, and there are no marks to guide us.&#8221;&#160;
As he spoke two men came down the garden path, from
round the angle of the house.&#160; The one was an
elderly man, with a strong, deep-lined, heavy-eyed
face; the other a dashing young fellow, whose bright,
smiling expression and showy dress were in strange
contract with the business which had brought us there.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Still at it, then?&#8221; said
he to Holmes.&#160; &#8220;I thought you Londoners were
never at fault.&#160; You don&#8217;t seem to be so
very quick, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, you must give us a little
time,&#8221; said Holmes good-humoredly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You&#8217;ll want it,&#8221;
said young Alec Cunningham.&#160; &#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t
see that we have any clue at all.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There&#8217;s only one,&#8221;
answered the Inspector.&#160; &#8220;We thought that
if we could only find&#8212;&#173;Good heavens, Mr.
Holmes!&#160; What is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">My poor friend&#8217;s face had suddenly
assumed the most dreadful expression.&#160; His eyes
rolled upwards, his features writhed in agony, and
with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon
the ground.&#160; Horrified at the suddenness and severity
of the attack, we carried him into the kitchen, where
he lay back in a large chair, and breathed heavily
for some minutes.&#160; Finally, with a shamefaced
apology for his weakness, he rose once more.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Watson would tell you that
I have only just recovered from a severe illness,&#8221;
he explained.&#160; &#8220;I am liable to these sudden
nervous attacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I send you home in my trap?&#8221; asked
old Cunningham.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, since I am here, there
is one point on which I should like to feel sure.&#160;
We can very easily verify it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, it seems to me that it
is just possible that the arrival of this poor fellow
William was not before, but after, the entrance of
the burglary into the house.&#160; You appear to take
it for granted that, although the door was forced,
the robber never got in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I fancy that is quite obvious,&#8221;
said Mr. Cunningham, gravely.&#160; &#8220;Why, my
son Alec had not yet gone to bed, and he would certainly
have heard any one moving about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where was he sitting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was smoking in my dressing-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which window is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The last on the left next my father&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of your lamps were lit, of course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There are some very singular
points here,&#8221; said Holmes, smiling.&#160; &#8220;Is
it not extraordinary that a burglary&#8212;&#173;and
a burglar who had had some previous experience&#8212;&#173;should
deliberately break into a house at a time when he
could see from the lights that two of the family were
still afoot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have been a cool hand.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, of course, if the case
were not an odd one we should not have been driven
to ask you for an explanation,&#8221; said young Mr.
Alec.&#160; &#8220;But as to your ideas that the man
had robbed the house before William tackled him, I
think it a most absurd notion.&#160; Wouldn&#8217;t
we have found the place disarranged, and missed the
things which he had taken?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It depends on what the things
were,&#8221; said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;You must remember
that we are dealing with a burglar who is a very peculiar
fellow, and who appears to work on lines of his own.&#160;
Look, for example, at the queer lot of things which
he took from Acton&#8217;s&#8212;&#173;what was it?&#8212;&#173;a
ball of string, a letter-weight, and I don&#8217;t
know what other odds and ends.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, we are quite in your
hands, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said old Cunningham.&#160;
&#8220;Anything which you or the Inspector may suggest
will most certainly be done.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In the first place,&#8221;
said Holmes, &#8220;I should like you to offer a reward&#8212;&#173;coming
from yourself, for the officials may take a little
time before they would agree upon the sum, and these
things cannot be done too promptly.&#160; I have jotted
down the form here, if you would not mind signing
it.&#160; Fifty pounds was quite enough, I thought.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I would willingly give five
hundred,&#8221; said the J.P., taking the slip of
paper and the pencil which Holmes handed to him.&#160;
&#8220;This is not quite correct, however,&#8221;
he added, glancing over the document.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wrote it rather hurriedly.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You see you begin, &#8217;Whereas,
at about a quarter to one on Tuesday morning an attempt
was made,&#8217; and so on.&#160; It was at a quarter
to twelve, as a matter of fact.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I was pained at the mistake, for I
knew how keenly Holmes would feel any slip of the
kind.&#160; It was his specialty to be accurate as to
fact, but his recent illness had shaken him, and this
one little incident was enough to show me that he
was still far from being himself.&#160; He was obviously
embarrassed for an instant, while the Inspector raised
his eyebrows, and Alec Cunningham burst into a laugh.&#160;
The old gentleman corrected the mistake, however,
and handed the paper back to Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Get it printed as soon as possible,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;I think your idea is an excellent
one.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes put the slip of paper carefully
away into his pocket-book.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it
really would be a good thing that we should all go
over the house together and make certain that this
rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything
away with him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Before entering, Holmes made an examination
of the door which had been forced.&#160; It was evident
that a chisel or strong knife had been thrust in,
and the lock forced back with it.&#160; We could see
the marks in the wood where it had been pushed in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t use bars, then?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have never found it necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t keep a dog?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but he is chained on the other side of
the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When do the servants go to bed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand that William was usually in bed
also at that hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is singular that on this
particular night he should have been up.&#160; Now,
I should be very glad if you would have the kindness
to show us over the house, Mr. Cunningham.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A stone-flagged passage, with the
kitchens branching away from it, led by a wooden staircase
directly to the first floor of the house.&#160; It came
out upon the landing opposite to a second more ornamental
stair which came up from the front hall.&#160; Out
of this landing opened the drawing-room and several
bedrooms, including those of Mr. Cunningham and his
son.&#160; Holmes walked slowly, taking keen note of
the architecture of the house.&#160; I could tell from
his expression that he was on a hot scent, and yet
I could not in the least imagine in what direction
his inferences were leading him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My good sir,&#8221; said Mr.
Cunningham with some impatience, &#8220;this is surely
very unnecessary.&#160; That is my room at the end of
the stairs, and my son&#8217;s is the one beyond it.&#160;
I leave it to your judgment whether it was possible
for the thief to have come up here without disturbing
us.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You must try round and get
on a fresh scent, I fancy,&#8221; said the son with
a rather malicious smile.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Still, I must ask you to humor
me a little further.&#160; I should like, for example,
to see how far the windows of the bedrooms command
the front.&#160; This, I understand is your son&#8217;s
room&#8221;&#8212;&#173;he pushed open the door&#8212;&#173;&#8220;and
that, I presume, is the dressing-room in which he sat
smoking when the alarm was given.&#160; Where does
the window of that look out to?&#8221; He stepped
across the bedroom, pushed open the door, and glanced
round the other chamber.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I hope that you are satisfied
now?&#8221; said Mr. Cunningham, tartly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I think I have seen all that I wished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if it is really necessary we can go into
my room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is not too much trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The J. P. shrugged his shoulders,
and led the way into his own chamber, which was a
plainly furnished and commonplace room.&#160; As we
moved across it in the direction of the window, Holmes
fell back until he and I were the last of the group.&#160;
Near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges and
a carafe of water.&#160; As we passed it Holmes, to
my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in front
of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over.&#160;
The glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit
rolled about into every corner of the room.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You&#8217;ve done it now, Watson,&#8221;
said he, coolly.&#160; &#8220;A pretty mess you&#8217;ve
made of the carpet.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I stooped in some confusion and began
to pick up the fruit, understanding for some reason
my companion desired me to take the blame upon myself.&#160;
The others did the same, and set the table on its legs
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; cried the Inspector, &#8220;where&#8217;s
he got to?&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes had disappeared.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Wait here an instant,&#8221;
said young Alec Cunningham.&#160; &#8220;The fellow
is off his head, in my opinion.&#160; Come with me,
father, and see where he has got to!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">They rushed out of the room, leaving
the Inspector, the Colonel, and me staring at each
other.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Pon my word, I am inclined
to agree with Master Alec,&#8221; said the official.&#160;
&#8220;It may be the effect of this illness, but it
seems to me that&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">His words were cut short by a sudden
scream of &#8220;Help!&#160; Help!&#160; Murder!&#8221;
With a thrill I recognized the voice of that of my
friend.&#160; I rushed madly from the room on to the
landing.&#160; The cries, which had sunk down into
a hoarse, inarticulate shouting, came from the room
which we had first visited.&#160; I dashed in, and
on into the dressing-room beyond.&#160; The two Cunninghams
were bending over the prostrate figure of Sherlock
Holmes, the younger clutching his throat with both
hands, while the elder seemed to be twisting one of
his wrists.&#160; In an instant the three of us had
torn them away from him, and Holmes staggered to his
feet, very pale and evidently greatly exhausted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest these men, Inspector,&#8221; he gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;On what charge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That of murdering their coachman, William Kirwan.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The Inspector stared about him in
bewilderment.&#160; &#8220;Oh, come now, Mr. Holmes,&#8221;
said he at last, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t
really mean to&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut, man, look at their faces!&#8221; cried
Holmes, curtly.</p>

<p align="justify">Never certainly have I seen a plainer
confession of guilt upon human countenances.&#160;
The older man seemed numbed and dazed with a heavy,
sullen expression upon his strongly-marked face.&#160;
The son, on the other hand, had dropped all that jaunty,
dashing style which had characterized him, and the
ferocity of a dangerous wild beast gleamed in his dark
eyes and distorted his handsome features.&#160; The
Inspector said nothing, but, stepping to the door,
he blew his whistle.&#160; Two of his constables came
at the call.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have no alternative, Mr.
Cunningham,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;I trust that
this may all prove to be an absurd mistake, but you
can see that&#8212;&#173;Ah, would you?&#160; Drop it!&#8221;
He struck out with his hand, and a revolver which the
younger man was in the act of cocking clattered down
upon the floor.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Keep that,&#8221; said Holmes,
quietly putting his foot upon it; &#8220;you will
find it useful at the trial.&#160; But this is what
we really wanted.&#8221;&#160; He held up a little
crumpled piece of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;The remainder of the sheet!&#8221; cried the
Inspector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where was it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Where I was sure it must be.&#160;
I&#8217;ll make the whole matter clear to you presently.&#160;
I think, Colonel, that you and Watson might return
now, and I will be with you again in an hour at the
furthest.&#160; The Inspector and I must have a word
with the prisoners, but you will certainly see me back
at luncheon time.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Sherlock Holmes was as good as his
word, for about one o&#8217;clock he rejoined us in
the Colonel&#8217;s smoking-room.&#160; He was accompanied
by a little elderly gentleman, who was introduced
to me as the Mr. Acton whose house had been the scene
of the original burglary.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I wished Mr. Acton to be present
while I demonstrated this small matter to you,&#8221;
said Holmes, &#8220;for it is natural that he should
take a keen interest in the details.&#160; I am afraid,
my dear Colonel, that you must regret the hour that
you took in such a stormy petrel as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; answered
the Colonel, warmly, &#8220;I consider it the greatest
privilege to have been permitted to study your methods
of working.&#160; I confess that they quite surpass
my expectations, and that I am utterly unable to account
for your result.&#160; I have not yet seen the vestige
of a clue.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am afraid that my explanation
may disillusion you but it has always been my habit
to hide none of my methods, either from my friend Watson
or from any one who might take an intelligent interest
in them.&#160; But, first, as I am rather shaken by
the knocking about which I had in the dressing-room,
I think that I shall help myself to a dash of your
brandy, Colonel.&#160; My strength had been rather tried
of late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust that you had no more of those nervous
attacks.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Sherlock Holmes laughed heartily.&#160;
&#8220;We will come to that in its turn,&#8221; said
he.&#160; &#8220;I will lay an account of the case before
you in its due order, showing you the various points
which guided me in my decision.&#160; Pray interrupt
me if there is any inference which is not perfectly
clear to you.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is of the highest importance
in the art of detection to be able to recognize, out
of a number of facts, which are incidental and which
vital.&#160; Otherwise your energy and attention must
be dissipated instead of being concentrated.&#160;
Now, in this case there was not the slightest doubt
in my mind from the first that the key of the whole
matter must be looked for in the scrap of paper in
the dead man&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Before going into this, I would
draw your attention to the fact that, if Alec Cunningham&#8217;s
narrative was correct, and if the assailant, after
shooting William Kirwan, had instantly fled, then it
obviously could not be he who tore the paper from
the dead man&#8217;s hand.&#160; But if it was not he,
it must have been Alec Cunningham himself, for by the
time that the old man had descended several servants
were upon the scene.&#160; The point is a simple one,
but the Inspector had overlooked it because he had
started with the supposition that these county magnates
had had nothing to do with the matter.&#160; Now, I
make a point of never having any prejudices, and of
following docilely wherever fact may lead me, and so,
in the very first stage of the investigation, I found
myself looking a little askance at the part which
had been played by Mr. Alec Cunningham.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And now I made a very careful
examination of the corner of paper which the Inspector
had submitted to us.&#160; It was at once clear to me
that it formed part of a very remarkable document.&#160;
Here it is.&#160; Do you not now observe something
very suggestive about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has a very irregular look,&#8221; said the
Colonel.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; cried Holmes,
&#8220;there cannot be the least doubt in the world
that it has been written by two persons doing alternate
words.&#160; When I draw your attention to the strong
t&#8217;s of &#8216;at&#8217; and &#8216;to&#8217;,
and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of
&#8216;quarter&#8217; and &#8216;twelve,&#8217; you
will instantly recognize the fact.&#160; A very brief
analysis of these four words would enable you to say
with the utmost confidence that the &#8216;learn&#8217;
and the &#8216;maybe&#8217; are written in the stronger
hand, and the &#8216;what&#8217; in the weaker.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By Jove, it&#8217;s as clear
as day!&#8221; cried the Colonel.&#160; &#8220;Why on
earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Obviously the business was
a bad one, and one of the men who distrusted the other
was determined that, whatever was done, each should
have an equal hand in it.&#160; Now, of the two men,
it is clear that the one who wrote the &#8216;at&#8217;
and &#8216;to&#8217; was the ringleader.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you get at that?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We might deduce it from the
mere character of the one hand as compared with the
other.&#160; But we have more assured reasons than that
for supposing it.&#160; If you examine this scrap with
attention you will come to the conclusion that the
man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first,
leaving blanks for the other to fill up.&#160; These
blanks were not always sufficient, and you can see
that the second man had a squeeze to fit his &#8216;quarter&#8217;
in between the &#8216;at&#8217; and the &#8216;to,&#8217;
showing that the latter were already written.&#160;
The man who wrote all his words first is undoubtedly
the man who planned the affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; cried Mr. Acton.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But very superficial,&#8221;
said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;We come now, however, to a
point which is of importance.&#160; You may not be
aware that the deduction of a man&#8217;s age from
his writing is one which has brought to considerable
accuracy by experts.&#160; In normal cases one can place
a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence.&#160;
I say normal cases, because ill-health and physical
weakness reproduce the signs of old age, even when
the invalid is a youth.&#160; In this case, looking
at the bold, strong hand of the one, and the rather
broken-backed appearance of the other, which still
retains its legibility although the t&#8217;s have
begun to lose their crossing, we can say that the
one was a young man and the other was advanced in
years without being positively decrepit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; cried Mr. Acton again.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is a further point, however,
which is subtler and of greater interest.&#160; There
is something in common between these hands.&#160; They
belong to men who are blood-relatives.&#160; It may
be most obvious to you in the Greek e&#8217;s, but
to me there are many small points which indicate the
same thing.&#160; I have no doubt at all that a family
mannerism can be traced in these two specimens of
writing.&#160; I am only, of course, giving you the
leading results now of my examination of the paper.&#160;
There were twenty-three other deductions which would
be of more interest to experts than to you.&#160; They
all tend to deepen the impression upon my mind that
the Cunninghams, father and son, had written this letter.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Having got so far, my next
step was, of course, to examine into the details of
the crime, and to see how far they would help us.&#160;
I went up to the house with the Inspector, and saw
all that was to be seen.&#160; The wound upon the dead
man was, as I was able to determine with absolute
confidence, fired from a revolver at the distance of
something over four yards.&#160; There was no powder-blackening
on the clothes.&#160; Evidently, therefore, Alec Cunningham
had lied when he said that the two men were struggling
when the shot was fired.&#160; Again, both father and
son agreed as to the place where the man escaped into
the road.&#160; At that point, however, as it happens,
there is a broadish ditch, moist at the bottom.&#160;
As there were no indications of bootmarks about this
ditch, I was absolutely sure not only that the Cunninghams
had again lied, but that there had never been any
unknown man upon the scene at all.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And now I have to consider
the motive of this singular crime.&#160; To get at
this, I endeavored first of all to solve the reason
of the original burglary at Mr. Acton&#8217;s.&#160;
I understood, from something which the Colonel told
us, that a lawsuit had been going on between you, Mr.
Acton, and the Cunninghams.&#160; Of course, it instantly
occurred to me that they had broken into your library
with the intention of getting at some document which
might be of importance in the case.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Precisely so,&#8221; said Mr.
Acton.&#160; &#8220;There can be no possible doubt as
to their intentions.&#160; I have the clearest claim
upon half of their present estate, and if they could
have found a single paper&#8212;&#173;which, fortunately,
was in the strong-box of my solicitors&#8212;&#173;they
would undoubtedly have crippled our case.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There you are,&#8221; said
Holmes, smiling.&#160; &#8220;It was a dangerous, reckless
attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of
young Alec.&#160; Having found nothing they tried to
divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary
burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they
could lay their hands upon.&#160; That is all clear
enough, but there was much that was still obscure.&#160;
What I wanted above all was to get the missing part
of that note.&#160; I was certain that Alec had torn
it out of the dead man&#8217;s hand, and almost certain
that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his
dressing-gown.&#160; Where else could he have put it?&#160;
The only question was whether it was still there.&#160;
It was worth an effort to find out, and for that object
we all went up to the house.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The Cunninghams joined us,
as you doubtless remember, outside the kitchen door.&#160;
It was, of course, of the very first importance that
they should not be reminded of the existence of this
paper, otherwise they would naturally destroy it without
delay.&#160; The Inspector was about to tell them the
importance which we attached to it when, by the luckiest
chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit
and so changed the conversation.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; cried
the Colonel, laughing, &#8220;do you mean to say all
our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Speaking professionally, it
was admirably done,&#8221; cried I, looking in amazement
at this man who was forever confounding me with some
new phase of his astuteness.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is an art which is often
useful,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;When I recovered
I managed, by a device which had perhaps some little
merit of ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write
the word &#8216;twelve,&#8217; so that I might compare
it with the &#8216;twelve&#8217; upon the paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what an ass I have been!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I could see that you were commiserating
me over my weakness,&#8221; said Holmes, laughing.&#160;
&#8220;I was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain
which I know that you felt.&#160; We then went upstairs
together, and having entered the room and seen the
dressing-gown hanging up behind the door, I contrived,
by upsetting a table, to engage their attention for
the moment, and slipped back to examine the pockets.&#160;
I had hardly got the paper, however&#8212;&#173;which
was, as I had expected, in one of them&#8212;&#173;when
the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily
believe, have murdered me then and there but for your
prompt and friendly aid.&#160; As it is, I feel that
young man&#8217;s grip on my throat now, and the father
has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get the
paper out of my hand.&#160; They saw that I must know
all about it, you see, and the sudden change from absolute
security to complete despair made them perfectly desperate.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I had a little talk with old
Cunningham afterwards as to the motive of the crime.&#160;
He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect
demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else&#8217;s
brains if he could have got to his revolver.&#160;
When Cunningham saw that the case against him was so
strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of
everything.&#160; It seems that William had secretly
followed his two masters on the night when they made
their raid upon Mr. Acton&#8217;s, and having thus
got them into his power, proceeded, under threats
of exposure, to levy blackmail upon them.&#160; Mr.
Alec, however, was a dangerous man to play games of
that sort with.&#160; It was a stroke of positive genius
on his part to see in the burglary scare which was
convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly
getting rid of the man whom he feared.&#160; William
was decoyed up and shot, and had they only got the
whole of the note and paid a little more attention
to detail in the accessories, it is very possible that
suspicion might never have been aroused.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the note?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes placed the subjoined paper before
us.</p>

<blockquote>If you will only come around to the
east gate you it will very much surprise you
and be of the greatest service to you and also
to Annie Morrison.&#160; But say nothing to anyone upon
the matter.</blockquote>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is very much the sort of
thing that I expected,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;Of
course, we do not yet know what the relations may have
been between Alec Cunningham, William Kirwan, and
Annie Morrison.&#160; The results shows that the trap
was skillfully baited.&#160; I am sure that you cannot
fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown
in the p&#8217;s and in the tails of the g&#8217;s.&#160;
The absence of the i-dots in the old man&#8217;s writing
is also most characteristic.&#160; Watson, I think
our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct
success, and I shall certainly return much invigorated
to Baker Street to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Adventure VII.&#160; The Crooked Man</h1>

<p align="justify">One summer night, a few months after
my marriage, I was seated by my own hearth smoking
a last pipe and nodding over a novel, for my day&#8217;s
work had been an exhausting one.&#160; My wife had
already gone upstairs, and the sound of the locking
of the hall door some time before told me that the
servants had also retired.&#160; I had risen from my
seat and was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when
I suddenly heard the clang of the bell.</p>

<p align="justify">I looked at the clock.&#160; It was
a quarter to twelve.&#160; This could not be a visitor
at so late an hour.&#160; A patient, evidently, and
possibly an all-night sitting.&#160; With a wry face
I went out into the hall and opened the door.&#160;
To my astonishment it was Sherlock Holmes who stood
upon my step.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, Watson,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;I hoped that I might not be too late to catch
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, pray come in.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You look surprised, and no
wonder!&#160; Relieved, too, I fancy!&#160; Hum!&#160;
You still smoke the Arcadia mixture of your bachelor
days then!&#160; There&#8217;s no mistaking that fluffy
ash upon your coat.&#160; It&#8217;s easy to tell that
you have been accustomed to wear a uniform, Watson.&#160;
You&#8217;ll never pass as a pure-bred civilian as
long as you keep that habit of carrying your handkerchief
in your sleeve.&#160; Could you put me up to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You told me that you had bachelor
quarters for one, and I see that you have no gentleman
visitor at present.&#160; Your hat-stand proclaims as
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted if you will stay.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Thank you.&#160; I&#8217;ll
fill the vacant peg then.&#160; Sorry to see that you&#8217;ve
had the British workman in the house.&#160; He&#8217;s
a token of evil.&#160; Not the drains, I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, the gas.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah!&#160; He has left two nail-marks
from his boot upon your linoleum just where the light
strikes it.&#160; No, thank you, I had some supper at
Waterloo, but I&#8217;ll smoke a pipe with you with
pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I handed him my pouch, and he seated
himself opposite to me and smoked for some time in
silence.&#160; I was well aware that nothing but business
of importance would have brought him to me at such
an hour, so I waited patiently until he should come
round to it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I see that you are professionally
rather busy just now,&#8221; said he, glancing very
keenly across at me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve had a busy
day,&#8221; I answered.&#160; &#8220;It may seem very
foolish in your eyes,&#8221; I added, &#8220;but really
I don&#8217;t know how you deduced it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes chuckled to himself.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have the advantage of knowing
your habits, my dear Watson,&#8221; said he.&#160;
&#8220;When your round is a short one you walk, and
when it is a long one you use a hansom.&#160; As I
perceive that your boots, although used, are by no
means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present
busy enough to justify the hansom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Elementary,&#8221; said he.&#160;
&#8220;It is one of those instances where the reasoner
can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his
neighbor, because the latter has missed the one little
point which is the basis of the deduction.&#160; The
same may be said, my dear fellow, for the effect of
some of these little sketches of yours, which is entirely
meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining
in your own hands some factors in the problem which
are never imparted to the reader.&#160; Now, at present
I am in the position of these same readers, for I hold
in this hand several threads of one of the strangest
cases which ever perplexed a man&#8217;s brain, and
yet I lack the one or two which are needful to complete
my theory.&#160; But I&#8217;ll have them, Watson, I&#8217;ll
have them!&#8221; His eyes kindled and a slight flush
sprang into his thin cheeks.&#160; For an instant only.&#160;
When I glanced again his face had resumed that red-Indian
composure which had made so many regard him as a machine
rather than a man.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The problem presents features
of interest,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;I may even
say exceptional features of interest.&#160; I have
already looked into the matter, and have come, as
I think, within sight of my solution.&#160; If you could
accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable
service to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be delighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you go as far as Aldershot to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt Jackson would take my practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;V&#233;ry good.&#160; I want to start by the 11.10
from Waterloo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would give me time.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then, if you are not too sleepy,
I will give you a sketch of what has happened, and
of what remains to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sleepy before you came.&#160; I am quite
wakeful now.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I will compress the story as
far as may be done without omitting anything vital
to the case.&#160; It is conceivable that you may even
have read some account of the matter.&#160; It is the
supposed murder of Colonel Barclay, of the <i>Royal</i>
<i>Munsters</i>, at Aldershot, which I am investigating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard nothing of it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It has not excited much attention
yet, except locally.&#160; The facts are only two days
old.&#160; Briefly they are these:&#160;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The <i>Royal</i> <i>Munsters</i>
is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish regiments
in the British army.&#160; It did wonders both in the
Crimea and the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished
itself upon every possible occasion.&#160; It was commanded
up to Monday night by James Barclay, a gallant veteran,
who started as a full private, was raised to commissioned
rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and
so lived to command the regiment in which he had once
carried a musket.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Colonel Barclay had married
at the time when he was a sergeant, and his wife,
whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter
of a former color-sergeant in the same corps.&#160;
There was, therefore, as can be imagined, some little
social friction when the young couple (for they were
still young) found themselves in their new surroundings.&#160;
They appear, however, to have quickly adapted themselves,
and Mrs. Barclay has always, I understand, been as
popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband
was with his brother officers.&#160; I may add that
she was a woman of great beauty, and that even now,
when she has been married for upwards of thirty years,
she is still of a striking and queenly appearance.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Colonel Barclay&#8217;s family
life appears to have been a uniformly happy one.&#160;
Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures
me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding
between the pair.&#160; On the whole, he thinks that
Barclay&#8217;s devotion to his wife was greater than
his wife&#8217;s to Barclay.&#160; He was acutely uneasy
if he were absent from her for a day.&#160; She, on
the other hand, though devoted and faithful, was less
obtrusively affectionate.&#160; But they were regarded
in the regiment as the very model of a middle-aged
couple.&#160; There was absolutely nothing in their
mutual relations to prepare people for the tragedy
which was to follow.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Colonel Barclay himself seems
to have had some singular traits in his character.&#160;
He was a dashing, jovial old soldier in his usual mood,
but there were occasions on which he seemed to show
himself capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness.&#160;
This side of his nature, however, appears never to
have been turned towards his wife.&#160; Another fact,
which had struck Major Murphy and three out of five
of the other officers with whom I conversed, was the
singular sort of depression which came upon him at
times.&#160; As the major expressed it, the smile had
often been struck from his mouth, as if by some invisible
hand, when he has been joining the gayeties and chaff
of the mess-table.&#160; For days on end, when the
mood was on him, he has been sunk in the deepest gloom.&#160;
This and a certain tinge of superstition were the only
unusual traits in his character which his brother
officers had observed.&#160; The latter peculiarity
took the form of a dislike to being left alone, especially
after dark.&#160; This puerile feature in a nature which
was conspicuously manly had often given rise to comment
and conjecture.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The first battalion of the
<i>Royal</i> <i>Munsters</i> (which is the old 117th) has
been stationed at Aldershot for some years.&#160; The
married officers live out of barracks, and the Colonel
has during all this time occupied a villa called Lachine,
about half a mile from the north camp.&#160; The house
stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it
is not more than thirty yards from the high-road.&#160;
A coachman and two maids form the staff of servants.&#160;
These with their master and mistress were the sole
occupants of Lachine, for the <i>Barclays</i> had no
children, nor was it usual for them to have resident
visitors.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Now for the events at Lachine
between nine and ten on the evening of last Monday.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mrs. Barclay was, it appears,
a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and had interested
herself very much in the establishment of the Guild
of St. George, which was formed in connection with
the Watt Street Chapel for the purpose of supplying
the poor with cast-off clothing.&#160; A meeting of
the Guild had been held that evening at eight, and
Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order
to be present at it.&#160; When leaving the house she
was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace
remark to her husband, and to assure him that she would
be back before very long.&#160; She then called for
Miss Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next
villa, and the two went off together to their meeting.&#160;
It lasted forty minutes, and at a quarter-past nine
Mrs. Barclay returned home, having left Miss Morrison
at her door as she passed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is a room which is used
as a morning-room at Lachine.&#160; This faces the
road and opens by a large glass folding-door on to
the lawn.&#160; The lawn is thirty yards across, and
is only divided from the highway by a low wall with
an iron rail above it.&#160; It was into this room that
Mrs. Barclay went upon her return.&#160; The blinds
were not down, for the room was seldom used in the
evening, but Mrs. Barclay herself lit the lamp and
then rang the bell, asking Jane Stewart, the house-maid,
to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary
to her usual habits.&#160; The Colonel had been sitting
in the dining-room, but hearing that his wife had
returned he joined her in the morning-room.&#160; The
coachman saw him cross the hall and enter it.&#160;
He was never seen again alive.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The tea which had been ordered
was brought up at the end of ten minutes; but the
maid, as she approached the door, was surprised to
hear the voices of her master and mistress in furious
altercation.&#160; She knocked without receiving any
answer, and even turned the handle, but only to find
that the door was locked upon the inside.&#160; Naturally
enough she ran down to tell the cook, and the two
women with the coachman came up into the hall and
listened to the dispute which was still raging.&#160;
They all agreed that only two voices were to be heard,
those of Barclay and of his wife.&#160; Barclay&#8217;s
remarks were subdued and abrupt, so that none of them
were audible to the listeners.&#160; The lady&#8217;s,
on the other hand, were most bitter, and when she
raised her voice could be plainly heard.&#160; &#8216;You
coward!&#8217; she repeated over and over again.&#160;
&#8217;What can be done now?&#160; What can be done
now?&#160; Give me back my life.&#160; I will never so
much as breathe the same air with you again!&#160;
You coward!&#160; You coward!&#8217; Those were scraps
of her conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry
in the man&#8217;s voice, with a crash, and a piercing
scream from the woman.&#160; Convinced that some tragedy
had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and
strove to force it, while scream after scream issued
from within.&#160; He was unable, however, to make
his way in, and the maids were too distracted with
fear to be of any assistance to him.&#160; A sudden
thought struck him, however, and he ran through the
hall door and round to the lawn upon which the long
French windows open.&#160; One side of the window was
open, which I understand was quite usual in the summer-time,
and he passed without difficulty into the room.&#160;
His mistress had ceased to scream and was stretched
insensible upon a couch, while with his feet tilted
over the side of an arm-chair, and his head upon the
ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the
unfortunate soldier stone dead in a pool of his own
blood.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Naturally, the coachman&#8217;s
first thought, on finding that he could do nothing
for his master, was to open the door.&#160; But here
an unexpected and singular difficulty presented itself.&#160;
The key was not in the inner side of the door, nor
could he find it anywhere in the room.&#160; He went
out again, therefore, through the window, and having
obtained the help of a policeman and of a medical
man, he returned.&#160; The lady, against whom naturally
the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to her
room, still in a state of insensibility.&#160; The
Colonel&#8217;s body was then placed upon the sofa,
and a careful examination made of the scene of the
tragedy.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The injury from which the unfortunate
veteran was suffering was found to be a jagged cut
some two inches long at the back part of his head,
which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from
a blunt weapon.&#160; Nor was it difficult to guess
what that weapon may have been.&#160; Upon the floor,
close to the body, was lying a singular club of hard
carved wood with a bone handle.&#160; The Colonel possessed
a varied collection of weapons brought from the different
countries in which he had fought, and it is conjectured
by the police that his club was among his trophies.&#160;
The servants deny having seen it before, but among
the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible
that it may have been overlooked.&#160; Nothing else
of importance was discovered in the room by the police,
save the inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs.
Barclay&#8217;s person nor upon that of the victim
nor in any part of the room was the missing key to
be found.&#160; The door had eventually to be opened
by a locksmith from Aldershot.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That was the state of things,
Watson, when upon the Tuesday morning I, at the request
of Major Murphy, went down to Aldershot to supplement
the efforts of the police.&#160; I think that you will
acknowledge that the problem was already one of interest,
but my observations soon made me realize that it was
in truth much more extraordinary than would at first
sight appear.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Before examining the room I
cross-questioned the servants, but only succeeded
in eliciting the facts which I have already stated.&#160;
One other detail of interest was remembered by Jane
Stewart, the housemaid.&#160; You will remember that
on hearing the sound of the quarrel she descended and
returned with the other servants.&#160; On that first
occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices
of her master and mistress were sunk so low that she
could hear hardly anything, and judged by their tones
rather than their words that they had fallen out.&#160;
On my pressing her, however, she remembered that she
heard the word David uttered twice by the lady.&#160;
The point is of the utmost importance as guiding us
towards the reason of the sudden quarrel.&#160; The
Colonel&#8217;s name, you remember, was James.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There was one thing in the
case which had made the deepest impression both upon
the servants and the police.&#160; This was the contortion
of the Colonel&#8217;s face.&#160; It had set, according
to their account, into the most dreadful expression
of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable
of assuming.&#160; More than one person fainted at the
mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect.&#160;
It was quite certain that he had foreseen his fate,
and that it had caused him the utmost horror.&#160;
This, of course, fitted in well enough with the police
theory, if the Colonel could have seen his wife making
a murderous attack upon him.&#160; Nor was the fact
of the wound being on the back of his head a fatal
objection to this, as he might have turned to avoid
the blow.&#160; No information could be got from the
lady herself, who was temporarily insane from an acute
attack of brain-fever.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;From the police I learned that
Miss Morrison, who you remember went out that evening
with Mrs. Barclay, denied having any knowledge of what
it was which had caused the ill-humor in which her
companion had returned.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Having gathered these facts,
Watson, I smoked several pipes over them, trying to
separate those which were crucial from others which
were merely incidental.&#160; There could be no question
that the most distinctive and suggestive point in
the case was the singular disappearance of the door-key.&#160;
A most careful search had failed to discover it in
the room.&#160; Therefore it must have been taken from
it.&#160; But neither the Colonel nor the Colonel&#8217;s
wife could have taken it.&#160; That was perfectly clear.&#160;
Therefore a third person must have entered the room.&#160;
And that third person could only have come in through
the window.&#160; It seemed to me that a careful examination
of the room and the lawn might possibly reveal some
traces of this mysterious individual.&#160; You know
my methods, Watson.&#160; There was not one of them
which I did not apply to the inquiry.&#160; And it
ended by my discovering traces, but very different
ones from those which I had expected.&#160; There had
been a man in the room, and he had crossed the lawn
coming from the road.&#160; I was able to obtain five
very clear impressions of his foot-marks:&#160; one
in the roadway itself, at the point where he had climbed
the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint
ones upon the stained boards near the window where
he had entered.&#160; He had apparently rushed across
the lawn, for his toe-marks were much deeper than
his heels.&#160; But it was not the man who surprised
me.&#160; It was his companion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His companion!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue-paper
out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his
knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you make of that?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p align="justify">The paper was covered with he tracings
of the foot-marks of some small animal.&#160; It had
five well-marked foot-pads, an indication of long nails,
and the whole print might be nearly as large as a dessert-spoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dog,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Did you ever hear of a dog
running up a curtain?&#160; I found distinct traces
that this creature had done so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A monkey, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is not the print of a monkey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can it be, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Neither dog nor cat nor monkey
nor any creature that we are familiar with.&#160; I
have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements.&#160;
Here are four prints where the beast has been standing
motionless.&#160; You see that it is no less than fifteen
inches from fore-foot to hind.&#160; Add to that the
length of neck and head, and you get a creature not
much less than two feet long&#8212;&#173;probably more
if there is any tail.&#160; But now observe this other
measurement.&#160; The animal has been moving, and we
have the length of its stride.&#160; In each case it
is only about three inches.&#160; You have an indication,
you see, of a long body with very short legs attached
to it.&#160; It has not been considerate enough to
leave any of its hair behind it.&#160; But its general
shape must be what I have indicated, and it can run
up a curtain, and it is carnivorous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you deduce that?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because it ran up the curtain.&#160;
A canary&#8217;s cage was hanging in the window, and
its aim seems to have been to get at the bird.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what was the beast?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, if I could give it a name
it might go a long way towards solving the case.&#160;
On the whole, it was probably some creature of the
weasel and stoat tribe&#8212;&#173;and yet it is larger
than any of these that I have seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what had it to do with the crime?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That, also, is still obscure.&#160;
But we have learned a good deal, you perceive.&#160;
We know that a man stood in the road looking at the
quarrel between the <i>Barclays</i>&#8212;&#173;the blinds
were up and the room lighted.&#160; We know, also,
that he ran across the lawn, entered the room, accompanied
by a strange animal, and that he either struck the
Colonel or, as is equally possible, that the Colonel
fell down from sheer fright at the sight of him, and
cut his head on the corner of the fender.&#160; Finally,
we have the curious fact that the intruder carried
away the key with him when he left.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your discoveries seem to have
left the business more obscure that it was before,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Quite so.&#160; They undoubtedly
showed that the affair was much deeper than was at
first conjectured.&#160; I thought the matter over,
and I came to the conclusion that I must approach
the case from another aspect.&#160; But really, Watson,
I am keeping you up, and I might just as well tell
you all this on our way to Aldershot to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, you have gone rather too far to
stop.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is quite certain that when
Mrs. Barclay left the house at half-past seven she
was on good terms with her husband.&#160; She was never,
as I think I have said, ostentatiously affectionate,
but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the
Colonel in a friendly fashion.&#160; Now, it was equally
certain that, immediately on her return, she had gone
to the room in which she was least likely to see her
husband, had flown to tea as an agitated woman will,
and finally, on his coming in to her, had broken into
violent recriminations.&#160; Therefore something had
occurred between seven-thirty and nine o&#8217;clock
which had completely altered her feelings towards
him.&#160; But Miss Morrison had been with her during
the whole of that hour and a half.&#160; It was absolutely
certain, therefore, in spite of her denial, that she
must know something of the matter.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My first conjecture was, that
possibly there had been some passages between this
young lady and the old soldier, which the former had
now confessed to the wife.&#160; That would account
for the angry return, and also for the girl&#8217;s
denial that anything had occurred.&#160; Nor would it
be entirely incompatible with most of the words overhead.&#160;
But there was the reference to David, and there was
the known affection of the Colonel for his wife, to
weigh against it, to say nothing of the tragic intrusion
of this other man, which might, of course, be entirely
disconnected with what had gone before.&#160; It was
not easy to pick one&#8217;s steps, but, on the whole,
I was inclined to dismiss the idea that there had been
anything between the Colonel and Miss Morrison, but
more than ever convinced that the young lady held
the clue as to what it was which had turned Mrs. Barclay
to hatred of her husband.&#160; I took the obvious course,
therefore, of calling upon Miss M., of explaining
to her that I was perfectly certain that she held
the facts in her possession, and of assuring her that
her friend, Mrs. Barclay, might find herself in the
dock upon a capital charge unless the matter were
cleared up.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Miss Morrison is a little ethereal
slip of a girl, with timid eyes and blond hair, but
I found her by no means wanting in shrewdness and
common-sense.&#160; She sat thinking for some time after
I had spoken, and then, turning to me with a brisk
air of resolution, she broke into a remarkable statement
which I will condense for your benefit.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;I promised my friend
that I would say nothing of the matter, and a promise
is a promise,&#8217; said she; &#8217;but if I can
really help her when so serious a charge is laid against
her, and when her own mouth, poor darling, is closed
by illness, then I think I am absolved from my promise.&#160;
I will tell you exactly what happened upon Monday evening.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;We were returning from
the Watt Street Mission about a quarter to nine o&#8217;clock.&#160;
On our way we had to pass through Hudson Street, which
is a very quiet thoroughfare.&#160; There is only one
lamp in it, upon the left-hand side, and as we approached
this lamp I saw a man coming towards us with his back
very bent, and something like a box slung over one
of his shoulders.&#160; He appeared to be deformed,
for he carried his head low and walked with his knees
bent.&#160; We were passing him when he raised his
face to look at us in the circle of light thrown by
the lamp, and as he did so he stopped and screamed
out in a dreadful voice, &#8220;My God, it&#8217;s
Nancy!&#8221; Mrs. Barclay turned as white as death,
and would have fallen down had the dreadful-looking
creature not caught hold of her.&#160; I was going
to call for the police, but she, to my surprise, spoke
quite civilly to the fellow.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"I thought you had been
dead this thirty years, Henry,&#8221; said she, in
a shaking voice.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"So I have,&#8221; said
he, and it was awful to hear the tones that he said
it in.&#160; He had a very dark, fearsome face, and
a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams.&#160;
His hair and whiskers were shot with gray, and his
face was all crinkled and puckered like a withered
apple.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"Just walk on a little
way, dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Barclay; &#8220;I want
to have a word with this man.&#160; There is nothing
to be afraid of.&#8221;&#160; She tried to speak boldly,
but she was still deadly pale and could hardly get
her words out for the trembling of her lips.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;I did as she asked me,
and they talked together for a few minutes.&#160; Then
she came down the street with her eyes blazing, and
I saw the crippled wretch standing by the lamp-post
and shaking his clenched fists in the air as if he
were mad with rage.&#160; She never said a word until
we were at the door here, when she took me by the
hand and begged me to tell no one what had happened.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;"It&#8217;s an old acquaintance
of mine who has come down in the world,&#8221; said
she.&#160; When I promised her I would say nothing she
kissed me, and I have never seen her since.&#160; I
have told you now the whole truth, and if I withheld
it from the police it is because I did not realize
then the danger in which my dear friend stood.&#160;
I know that it can only be to her advantage that everything
should be known.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There was her statement, Watson,
and to me, as you can imagine, it was like a light
on a dark night.&#160; Everything which had been disconnected
before began at once to assume its true place, and
I had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence
of events.&#160; My next step obviously was to find
the man who had produced such a remarkable impression
upon Mrs. Barclay.&#160; If he were still in Aldershot
it should not be a very difficult matter.&#160; There
are not such a very great number of civilians, and
a deformed man was sure to have attracted attention.&#160;
I spent a day in the search, and by evening&#8212;&#173;this
very evening, Watson&#8212;&#173;I had run him down.&#160;
The man&#8217;s name is Henry Wood, and he lives in
lodgings in this same street in which the ladies met
him.&#160; He has only been five days in the place.&#160;
In the character of a registration-agent I had a most
interesting gossip with his landlady.&#160; The man
is by trade a conjurer and performer, going round
the canteens after nightfall, and giving a little
entertainment at each.&#160; He carries some creature
about with him in that box; about which the landlady
seemed to be in considerable trepidation, for she
had never seen an animal like it.&#160; He uses it in
some of his tricks according to her account.&#160;
So much the woman was able to tell me, and also that
it was a wonder the man lived, seeing how twisted he
was, and that he spoke in a strange tongue sometimes,
and that for the last two nights she had heard him
groaning and weeping in his bedroom.&#160; He was all
right, as far as money went, but in his deposit he
had given her what looked like a bad florin.&#160;
She showed it to me, Watson, and it was an Indian
rupee.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;So now, my dear fellow, you
see exactly how we stand and why it is I want you.&#160;
It is perfectly plain that after the ladies parted
from this man he followed them at a distance, that
he saw the quarrel between husband and wife through
the window, that he rushed in, and that the creature
which he carried in his box got loose.&#160; That is
all very certain.&#160; But he is the only person in
this world who can tell us exactly what happened in
that room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you intend to ask him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most certainly&#8212;&#173;but in the presence
of a witness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am the witness?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If you will be so good.&#160;
If he can clear the matter up, well and good.&#160;
If he refuses, we have no alternative but to apply
for a warrant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how do you know he&#8217;ll be there when
we return?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You may be sure that I took
some precautions.&#160; I have one of my Baker Street
boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him
like a burr, go where he might.&#160; We shall find
him in Hudson Street to-morrow, Watson, and meanwhile
I should be the criminal myself if I kept you out of
bed any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It was midday when we found ourselves
at the scene of the tragedy, and, under my companion&#8217;s
guidance, we made our way at once to Hudson Street.&#160;
In spite of his capacity for concealing his emotions,
I could easily see that Holmes was in a state of suppressed
excitement, while I was myself tingling with that
half-sporting, half-intellectual pleasure which I
invariably experienced when I associated myself with
him in his investigations.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This is the street,&#8221;
said he, as we turned into a short thoroughfare lined
with plain two-storied brick houses.&#160; &#8220;Ah,
here is Simpson to report.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He&#8217;s in all right, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; cried a small street Arab, running up
to us.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Good, Simpson!&#8221; said
Holmes, patting him on the head.&#160; &#8220;Come along,
Watson.&#160; This is the house.&#8221;&#160; He sent
in his card with a message that he had come on important
business, and a moment later we were face to face
with the man whom we had come to see.&#160; In spite
of the warm weather he was crouching over a fire,
and the little room was like an oven.&#160; The man
sat all twisted and huddled in his chair in a way which
gave an indescribably impression of deformity; but
the face which he turned towards us, though worn and
swarthy, must at some time have been remarkable for
its beauty.&#160; He looked suspiciously at us now out
of yellow-shot, bilious eyes, and, without speaking
or rising, he waved towards two chairs.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mr. Henry Wood, late of India,
I believe,&#8221; said Holmes, affably.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve
come over this little matter of Colonel Barclay&#8217;s
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What should I know about that?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That&#8217;s what I want to
ascertain.&#160; You know, I suppose, that unless the
matter is cleared up, Mrs. Barclay, who is an old friend
of yours, will in all probability be tried for murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man gave a violent start.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who you
are,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;nor how you come to know
what you do know, but will you swear that this is
true that you tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Why, they are only waiting
for her to come to her senses to arrest her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#160; Are you in the police yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What business is it of yours, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s every man&#8217;s business to see
justice done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can take my word that she is innocent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who killed Colonel James Barclay, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was a just providence that
killed him.&#160; But, mind you this, that if I had
knocked his brains out, as it was in my heart to do,
he would have had no more than his due from my hands.&#160;
If his own guilty conscience had not struck him down
it is likely enough that I might have had his blood
upon my soul.&#160; You want me to tell the story.&#160;
Well, I don&#8217;t know why I shouldn&#8217;t, for
there&#8217;s no cause for me to be ashamed of it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was in this way, sir.&#160;
You see me now with my back like a camel and my ribs
all awry, but there was a time when Corporal Henry
Wood was the smartest man in the 117th foot.&#160;
We were in India then, in cantonments, at a place
we&#8217;ll call Bhurtee.&#160; Barclay, who died the
other day, was sergeant in the same company as myself,
and the belle of the <i>regiment</i>, <i>ay</i>, and the
finest girl that ever had the breath of life between
her lips, was Nancy Devoy, the daughter of the color-sergeant.&#160;
There were two men that loved her, and one that she
loved, and you&#8217;ll smile when you look at this
poor thing huddled before the fire, and hear me say
that it was for my good looks that she loved me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, though I had her heart,
her father was set upon her marrying Barclay.&#160;
I was a <i>harum</i>-scarum, reckless lad, and he had
had an education, and was already marked for the sword-belt.&#160;
But the girl held true to me, and it seemed that I
would have had her when the Mutiny broke out, and
all hell was loose in the country.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We were shut up in Bhurtee,
the regiment of us with half a battery of artillery,
a company of Sikhs, and a lot of civilians and women-folk.&#160;
There were ten thousand rebels round us, and they were
as keen as a set of terriers round a rat-cage.&#160;
About the second week of it our water gave out, and
it was a question whether we could communicate with
General Neill&#8217;s column, which was moving up
country.&#160; It was our only chance, for we could
not hope to fight our way out with all the women and
children, so I volunteered to go out and to warn General
Neill of our danger.&#160; My offer was accepted, and
I talked it over with Sergeant Barclay, who was supposed
to know the ground better than any other man, and who
drew up a route by which I might get through the rebel
lines.&#160; At ten o&#8217;clock the same night I
started off upon my journey.&#160; There were a thousand
lives to save, but it was of only one that I was thinking
when I dropped over the wall that night.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My way ran down a dried-up
watercourse, which we hoped would screen me from the
enemy&#8217;s sentries; but as I crept round the corner
of it I walked right into six of them, who were crouching
down in the dark waiting for me.&#160; In an instant
I was stunned with a blow and bound hand and foot.&#160;
But the real blow was to my heart and not to my head,
for as I came to and listened to as much as I could
understand of their talk, I heard enough to tell me
that my comrade, the very man who had arranged the
way that I was to take, had betrayed me by means of
a native servant into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no need
for me to dwell on that part of it.&#160; You know now
what James Barclay was capable of.&#160; Bhurtee was
relieved by Neill next day, but the rebels took me
away with them in their retreat, and it was many a
long year before ever I saw a white face again.&#160;
I was tortured and tried to get away, and was captured
and tortured again.&#160; You can see for yourselves
the state in which I was left.&#160; Some of them that
fled into Nepaul took me with them, and then afterwards
I was up past Darjeeling.&#160; The hill-folk up there
murdered the rebels who had me, and I became their
slave for a time until I escaped; but instead of going
south I had to go north, until I found myself among
the Afghans.&#160; There I wandered about for many
a year, and at last came back to the Punjab, where
I lived mostly among the natives and picked up a living
by the conjuring tricks that I had learned.&#160; What
use was it for me, a wretched cripple, to go back
to England or to make myself known to my old comrades?&#160;
Even my wish for revenge would not make me do that.&#160;
I had rather that Nancy and my old pals should think
of Harry Wood as having died with a straight back,
than see him living and crawling with a stick like
a chimpanzee.&#160; They never doubted that I was dead,
and I meant that they never should.&#160; I heard that
Barclay had married Nancy, and that he was rising
rapidly in the regiment, but even that did not make
me speak.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But when one gets old one has
a longing for home.&#160; For years I&#8217;ve been
dreaming of the bright green fields and the hedges
of England.&#160; At last I determined to see them
before I died.&#160; I saved enough to bring me across,
and then I came here where the soldiers are, for I
know their ways and how to amuse them and so earn
enough to keep me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your narrative is most interesting,&#8221;
said Sherlock Holmes.&#160; &#8220;I have already heard
of your meeting with Mrs. Barclay, and your mutual
recognition.&#160; You then, as I understand, followed
her home and saw through the window an altercation
between her husband and her, in which she doubtless
cast his conduct to you in his teeth.&#160; Your own
feelings overcame you, and you ran across the lawn
and broke in upon them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I did, sir, and at the sight
of me he looked as I have never seen a man look before,
and over he went with his head on the fender.&#160;
But he was dead before he fell.&#160; I read death
on his face as plain as I can read that text over
the fire.&#160; The bare sight of me was like a bullet
through his guilty heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then Nancy fainted, and I caught
up the key of the door from her hand, intending to
unlock it and get help.&#160; But as I was doing it
it seemed to me better to leave it alone and get away,
for the thing might look black against me, and any
way my secret would be out if I were taken.&#160; In
my haste I thrust the key into my pocket, and dropped
my stick while I was chasing Teddy, who had run up
the curtain.&#160; When I got him into his box, from
which he had slipped, I was off as fast as I could
run.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Teddy?&#8221; asked Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">The man leaned over and pulled up
the front of a kind of hutch in the corner.&#160; In
an instant out there slipped a beautiful reddish-brown
creature, thin and lithe, with the legs of a stoat,
a long, thin nose, and a pair of the finest red eyes
that ever I saw in an animal&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mongoose,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, some call them that,
and some call them ichneumon,&#8221; said the man.&#160;
&#8220;Snake-catcher is what I call them, and Teddy
is amazing quick on <i>cobras</i>.&#160; I have one here
without the fangs, and Teddy catches it every night
to please the folk in the canteen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any other point, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, we may have to apply
to you again if Mrs. Barclay should prove to be in
serious trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case, of course, I&#8217;d come forward.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But if not, there is no object
in raking up this scandal against a dead man, foully
as he has acted.&#160; You have at least the satisfaction
of knowing that for thirty years of his life his conscience
bitterly reproached him for this wicked deed.&#160;
Ah, there goes Major Murphy on the other side of the
street.&#160; Good-by, Wood.&#160; I want to learn if
anything has happened since yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We were in time to overtake the major
before he reached the corner.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, Holmes,&#8221; he said:&#160;
&#8220;I suppose you have heard that all this fuss
has come to nothing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The inquest is just over.&#160;
The medical evidence showed conclusively that death
was due to apoplexy.&#160; You see it was quite a simple
case after all.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, remarkably superficial,&#8221;
said Holmes, smiling.&#160; &#8220;Come, Watson, I
don&#8217;t think we shall be wanted in Aldershot any
more.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing,&#8221;
said I, as we walked down to the station.&#160; &#8220;If
the husband&#8217;s name was James, and the other
was Henry, what was this talk about David?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That one word, my dear Watson,
should have told me the whole story had I been the
ideal reasoner which you are so fond of depicting.&#160;
It was evidently a term of reproach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of reproach?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes; David strayed a little
occasionally, you know, and on one occasion in the
same direction as Sergeant James Barclay.&#160; You
remember the small affair of Uriah and Bathsheba?&#160;
My biblical knowledge is a trifle rusty, I fear, but
you will find the story in the first or second of Samuel.&#8221;</p>

<mbp:pagebreak />
<h1>Adventure VIII.&#160; The Resident Patient</h1>

<p align="justify">Glancing over the somewhat incoherent
series of Memoirs with which I have endeavored to
illustrate a few of the mental peculiarities of my
friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have been struck by the
difficulty which I have experienced in picking out
examples which shall in every way answer my purpose.&#160;
For in those cases in which Holmes has performed some
tour de force of analytical reasoning, and has demonstrated
the value of his peculiar methods of investigation,
the facts themselves have often been so slight or
so commonplace that I could not feel justified in laying
them before the public.&#160; On the other hand, it
has frequently happened that he has been concerned
in some research where the facts have been of the
most remarkable and dramatic character, but where the
share which he has himself taken in determining their
causes has been less pronounced than I, as his biographer,
could wish.&#160; The small matter which I have chronicled
under the heading of &#8220;A Study in Scarlet,&#8221;
and that other later one connected with the loss of
the Gloria Scott, may serve as examples of this Scylla
and Charybdis which are forever threatening the historian.&#160;
It may be that in the business of which I am now about
to write the part which my friend played is not sufficiently
accentuated; and yet the whole train of circumstances
is so remarkable that I cannot bring myself to omit
it entirely from this series.</p>

<p align="justify">It had been a close, rainy day in
October.&#160; Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes
lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a
letter which he had received by the morning post.&#160;
For myself, my term of service in India had trained
me to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer
of 90 was no hardship.&#160; But the paper was uninteresting.&#160;
Parliament had risen.&#160; Everybody was out of town,
and I yearned for the glades of the New Forest or
the shingle of Southsea.&#160; A depleted bank account
had caused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my
companion, neither the country nor the sea presented
the slightest attraction to him.&#160; He loved to
lie in the very centre of five millions of people,
with his filaments stretching out and running through
them, responsive to every little rumor or suspicion
of unsolved crime.&#160; Appreciation of Nature found
no place among his many gifts, and his only change
was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of
the town to track down his brother of the country.</p>

<p align="justify">Finding that Holmes was too absorbed
for conversation, I had tossed aside the barren paper,
and leaning back in my chair, I fell into a brown
study.&#160; Suddenly my companion&#8217;s voice broke
in upon my thoughts.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are right, Watson,&#8221;
said he.&#160; &#8220;It does seem a very preposterous
way of settling a dispute.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Most preposterous!&#8221; I
exclaimed, and then, suddenly realizing how he had
echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my
chair and stared at him in blank amazement.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What is this, Holmes?&#8221;
I cried.&#160; &#8220;This is beyond anything which
I could have imagined.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed heartily at my perplexity.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You remember,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;that some little time ago, when I read you the
passage in one of Poe&#8217;s sketches, in which a
close reasoner follows the unspoken thought of his
companion, you were inclined to treat the matter as
a mere tour de force of the author.&#160; On my remarking
that I was constantly in the habit of doing the same
thing you expressed incredulity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Perhaps not with your tongue,
my dear Watson, but certainly with your eyebrows.&#160;
So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter upon
a train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity
of reading it off, and eventually of breaking into
it, as a proof that I had been in rapport with you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">But I was still far from satisfied.&#160;
&#8220;In the example which you read to me,&#8221;
said I, &#8220;the reasoner drew his conclusions from
the actions of the man whom he observed.&#160; If I
remember right, he stumbled over a heap of stones,
looked up at the stars, and so on.&#160; But I have
been seated quietly in my chair, and what clues can
I have given you?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You do yourself an injustice.&#160;
The features are given to man as the means by which
he shall express his emotions, and yours are faithful
servants.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Do you mean to say that you
read my train of thoughts from my features?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your features, and especially
your eyes.&#160; Perhaps you cannot yourself recall
how your reverie commenced?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then I will tell you.&#160;
After throwing down your paper, which was the action
which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a
minute with a vacant expression.&#160; Then your eyes
fixed themselves upon your newly-framed picture of
General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your
face that a train of thought had been started.&#160;
But it did not lead very far.&#160; Your eyes turned
across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher
which stands upon the top of your books.&#160; You then
glanced up at the wall, and of course your meaning
was obvious.&#160; You were thinking that if the portrait
were framed it would just cover that bare space and
correspond with Gordon&#8217;s picture over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have followed me wonderfully!&#8221; I
exclaimed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;So far I could hardly have
gone astray.&#160; But now your thoughts went back
to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were
studying the character in his features.&#160; Then
your eyes ceased to pucker, but you continued to look
across, and your face was thoughtful.&#160; You were
recalling the incidents of Beecher&#8217;s career.&#160;
I was well aware that you could not do this without
thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf
of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember
you expressing your passionate indignation at the way
in which he was received by the more turbulent of
our people.&#160; You felt so strongly about it that
I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking
of that also.&#160; When a moment later I saw your
eyes wander away from the picture, I suspected that
your mind had now turned to the Civil War, and when
I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled,
and your hands clinched, I was positive that you were
indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by
both sides in that desperate struggle.&#160; But then,
again, your face grew sadder; you shook your head.&#160;
You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and
useless waste of life.&#160; Your hand stole towards
your own old wound, and a smile quivered on your lips,
which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method
of settling international questions had forced itself
upon your mind.&#160; At this point I agreed with you
that it was preposterous, and was glad to find that
all my deductions had been correct.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Absolutely!&#8221; said I.&#160;
&#8220;And now that you have explained it, I confess
that I am as amazed as before.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was very superficial, my
dear Watson, I assure you.&#160; I should not have
intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some
incredulity the other day.&#160; But the evening has
brought a breeze with it.&#160; What do you say to
a ramble through London?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I was weary of our little sitting-room
and gladly acquiesced.&#160; For three hours we strolled
about together, watching the ever-changing kaleidoscope
of life as it ebbs and flows through Fleet Street and
the Strand.&#160; His characteristic talk, with its
keen observance of detail and subtle power of inference
held me amused and enthralled.&#160; It was ten o&#8217;clock
before we reached Baker Street again.&#160; A brougham
was waiting at our door.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Hum!&#160; A doctor&#8217;s&#8212;&#173;general
practitioner, I perceive,&#8221; said Holmes.&#160;
&#8220;Not been long in practice, but has had a good
deal to do.&#160; Come to consult us, I fancy!&#160;
Lucky we came back!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I was sufficiently conversant with
Holmes&#8217;s methods to be able to follow his reasoning,
and to see that the nature and state of the various
medical instruments in the wicker basket which hung
in the lamplight inside the brougham had given him
the data for his swift deduction.&#160; The light in
our window above showed that this late visit was indeed
intended for us.&#160; With some curiosity as to what
could have sent a brother medico to us at such an
hour, I followed Holmes into our sanctum.</p>

<p align="justify">A pale, taper-faced man with sandy
whiskers rose up from a chair by the fire as we entered.&#160;
His age may not have been more than three or four
and thirty, but his haggard expression and unhealthy
hue told of a life which has sapped his strength and
robbed him of his youth.&#160; His manner was nervous
and shy, like that of a sensitive gentleman, and the
thin white hand which he laid on the mantelpiece as
he rose was that of an artist rather than of a surgeon.&#160;
His dress was quiet and sombre&#8212;&#173;a black
frock-coat, dark trousers, and a touch of color about
his necktie.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Good-evening, doctor,&#8221;
said Holmes, cheerily.&#160; &#8220;I am glad to see
that you have only been waiting a very few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You spoke to my coachman, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No, it was the candle on the
side-table that told me.&#160; Pray resume your seat
and let me know how I can serve you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My name is Doctor Percy Trevelyan,&#8221;
said our visitor, &#8220;and I live at 403 Brook Street.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Are you not the author of a
monograph upon obscure nervous lesions?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">His pale cheeks flushed with pleasure
at hearing that his work was known to me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I so seldom hear of the work
that I thought it was quite dead,&#8221; said he.&#160;
&#8220;My publishers gave me a most discouraging account
of its sale.&#160; You are yourself, I presume, a medical
man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A retired army surgeon.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My own hobby has always been
nervous disease.&#160; I should wish to make it an
absolute specialty, but, of course, a man must take
what he can get at first.&#160; This, however, is beside
the question, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and I quite appreciate
how valuable your time is.&#160; The fact is that a
very singular train of events has occurred recently
at my house in Brook Street, and to-night they came
to such a head that I felt it was quite impossible
for me to wait another hour before asking for your
advice and assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Sherlock Holmes sat down and lit his
pipe.&#160; &#8220;You are very welcome to both,&#8221;
said he.&#160; &#8220;Pray let me have a detailed account
of what the circumstances are which have disturbed
you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;One or two of them are so trivial,&#8221;
said Dr. Trevelyan, &#8220;that really I am almost
ashamed to mention them.&#160; But the matter is so
inexplicable, and the recent turn which it has taken
is so elaborate, that I shall lay it all before you,
and you shall judge what is essential and what is
not.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am compelled, to begin with,
to say something of my own college career.&#160; I
am a London University man, you know, and I am sure
that your will not think that I am unduly singing
my own praises if I say that my student career was
considered by my professors to be a very promising
one.&#160; After I had graduated I continued to devote
myself to research, occupying a minor position in
King&#8217;s College Hospital, and I was fortunate
enough to excite considerable interest by my research
into the pathology of catalepsy, and finally to win
the Bruce Pinkerton prize and medal by the monograph
on nervous lesions to which your friend has just alluded.&#160;
I should not go too far if I were to say that there
was a general impression at that time that a distinguished
career lay before me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But the one great stumbling-block
lay in my want of capital.&#160; As you will readily
understand, a specialist who aims high is compelled
to start in one of a dozen streets in the Cavendish
Square quarter, all of which entail enormous rents
and furnishing expenses.&#160; Besides this preliminary
outlay, he must be prepared to keep himself for some
years, and to hire a presentable carriage and horse.&#160;
To do this was quite beyond my power, and I could
only hope that by economy I might in ten years&#8217;
time save enough to enable me to put up my plate.&#160;
Suddenly, however, an unexpected incident opened up
quite a new prospect to me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This was a visit from a gentleman
of the name of Blessington, who was a complete stranger
to me.&#160; He came up to my room one morning, and
plunged into business in an instant.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;You are the same Percy
Trevelyan who has had so distinguished a career and
won a great prize lately?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bowed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Answer me frankly,&#8217;
he continued, &#8217;for you will find it to your
interest to do so.&#160; You have all the cleverness
which makes a successful man.&#160; Have you the tact?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I could not help smiling at
the abruptness of the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I trust that I have my share,&#8217;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Any bad habits?&#160; Not drawn towards
drink, eh?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Really, sir!&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Quite right!&#160; That&#8217;s
all right!&#160; But I was bound to ask.&#160; With all
these qualities, why are you not in practice?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Come, come!&#8217; said
he, in his bustling way.&#160; &#8217;It&#8217;s the
old story.&#160; More in your brains than in your pocket,
eh?&#160; What would you say if I were to start you
in Brook Street?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s for my
sake, not for yours,&#8217; he cried.&#160; &#8217;I&#8217;ll
be perfectly frank with you, and if it suits you it
will suit me very well.&#160; I have a few thousands
to invest, d&#8217;ye see, and I think I&#8217;ll sink
them in you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But why?&#8217; I gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, it&#8217;s just like any other
speculation, and safer than most.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What am I to do, then?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;I&#8217;ll tell you.&#160;
I&#8217;ll take the house, furnish it, pay the maids,
and run the whole place.&#160; All you have to do is
just to wear out your chair in the consulting-room.&#160;
I&#8217;ll let you have pocket-money and everything.&#160;
Then you hand over to me three quarters of what you
earn, and you keep the other quarter for yourself.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This was the strange proposal,
Mr. Holmes, with which the man Blessington approached
me.&#160; I won&#8217;t weary you with the account of
how we bargained and negotiated.&#160; It ended in
my moving into the house next Lady-day, and starting
in practice on very much the same conditions as he
had suggested.&#160; He came himself to live with me
in the character of a resident patient.&#160; His heart
was weak, it appears, and he needed constant medical
supervision.&#160; He turned the two best rooms of the
first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself.&#160;
He was a man of singular habits, shunning company
and very seldom going out.&#160; His life was irregular,
but in one respect he was regularity itself.&#160; Every
evening, at the same hour, he walked into the consulting-room,
examined the books, put down five and three-pence
for every guinea that I had earned, and carried the
rest off to the strong-box in his own room.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I may say with confidence that
he never had occasion to regret his speculation.&#160;
From the first it was a success.&#160; A few good cases
and the reputation which I had won in the hospital
brought me rapidly to the front, and during the last
few years I have made him a rich man.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;So much, Mr. Holmes, for my
past history and my relations with Mr. Blessington.&#160;
It only remains for me now to tell you what has occurred
to bring me here to-night.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Some weeks ago Mr. Blessington
came down to me in, as it seemed to me, a state of
considerable agitation.&#160; He spoke of some burglary
which, he said, had been committed in the West End,
and he appeared, I remember, to be quite unnecessarily
excited about it, declaring that a day should not
pass before we should add stronger bolts to our windows
and doors.&#160; For a week he continued to be in a
peculiar state of restlessness, peering continually
out of the windows, and ceasing to take the short
walk which had usually been the prelude to his dinner.&#160;
From his manner it struck me that he was in mortal
dread of something or somebody, but when I questioned
him upon the point he became so offensive that I was
compelled to drop the subject.&#160; Gradually, as time
passed, his fears appeared to die away, and he had
renewed his former habits, when a fresh event reduced
him to the pitiable state of prostration in which he
now lies.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What happened was this.&#160;
Two days ago I received the letter which I now read
to you.&#160; Neither address nor date is attached to
it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;A Russian nobleman who
is now resident in England,&#8217; it runs, &#8217;would
be glad to avail himself of the professional assistance
of Dr. Percy Trevelyan.&#160; He has been for some
years a victim to cataleptic attacks, on which, as
is well known, Dr. Trevelyan is an authority.&#160;
He proposes to call at about quarter past six to-morrow
evening, if Dr. Trevelyan will make it convenient
to be at home.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This letter interested me deeply,
because the chief difficulty in the study of catalepsy
is the rareness of the disease.&#160; You may believe,
then, that I was in my consulting-room when, at the
appointed hour, the page showed in the patient.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He was an elderly man, thin,
demure, and commonplace&#8212;&#173;by no means the
conception one forms of a Russian nobleman.&#160; I
was much more struck by the appearance of his companion.&#160;
This was a tall young man, surprisingly handsome,
with a dark, fierce face, and the limbs and chest of
a Hercules.&#160; He had his hand under the other&#8217;s
arm as they entered, and helped him to a chair with
a tenderness which one would hardly have expected
from his appearance.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You will excuse my coming
in, doctor,&#8217; said he to me, speaking English
with a slight lisp.&#160; &#8217;This is my father,
and his health is a matter of the most overwhelming
importance to me.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I was touched by this filial
anxiety.&#160; &#8217;You would, perhaps, care to remain
during the consultation?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Not for the world,&#8217;
he cried with a gesture of horror.&#160; &#8217;It is
more painful to me than I can express.&#160; If I were
to see my father in one of these dreadful seizures
I am convinced that I should never survive it.&#160;
My own nervous system is an exceptionally sensitive
one.&#160; With your permission, I will remain in the
waiting-room while you go into my father&#8217;s case.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;To this, of course, I assented,
and the young man withdrew.&#160; The patient and I
then plunged into a discussion of his case, of which
I took exhaustive notes.&#160; He was not remarkable
for intelligence, and his answers were frequently
obscure, which I attributed to his limited acquaintance
with our language.&#160; Suddenly, however, as I sat
writing, he ceased to give any answer at all to my
inquiries, and on my turning towards him I was shocked
to see that he was sitting bolt upright in his chair,
staring at me with a perfectly blank and rigid face.&#160;
He was again in the grip of his mysterious malady.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My first feeling, as I have
just said, was one of pity and horror.&#160; My second,
I fear, was rather one of professional satisfaction.&#160;
I made notes of my patient&#8217;s pulse and temperature,
tested the rigidity of his muscles, and examined his
reflexes.&#160; There was nothing markedly abnormal
in any of these conditions, which harmonized with my
former experiences.&#160; I had obtained good results
in such cases by the inhalation of nitrite of amyl,
and the present seemed an admirable opportunity of
testing its virtues.&#160; The bottle was downstairs
in my laboratory, so leaving my patient seated in
his chair, I ran down to get it.&#160; There was some
little delay in finding it&#8212;&#173;five minutes,
let us say&#8212;&#173;and then I returned.&#160; Imagine
my amazement to find the room empty and the patient
gone.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Of course, my first act was
to run into the waiting-room.&#160; The son had gone
also.&#160; The hall door had been closed, but not shut.&#160;
My page who admits patients is a new boy and by no
means quick.&#160; He waits downstairs, and runs up
to show patients out when I ring the consulting-room
bell.&#160; He had heard nothing, and the affair remained
a complete mystery.&#160; Mr. Blessington came in from
his walk shortly afterwards, but I did not say anything
to him upon the subject, for, to tell the truth, I
have got in the way of late of holding as little communication
with him as possible.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, I never thought that
I should see anything more of the Russian and his
son, so you can imagine my amazement when, at the very
same hour this evening, they both came marching into
my consulting-room, just as they had done before.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;I feel that I owe you
a great many apologies for my abrupt departure yesterday,
doctor,&#8217; said my patient.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I confess that I was
very much surprised at it,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Well, the fact is,&#8217;
he remarked, &#8217;that when I recover from these
attacks my mind is always very clouded as to all that
has gone before.&#160; I woke up in a strange room,
as it seemed to me, and made my way out into the street
in a sort of dazed way when you were absent.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;And I,&#8217; said the
son, &#8217;seeing my father pass the door of the
waiting-room, naturally thought that the consultation
had come to an end.&#160; It was not until we had reached
home that I began to realize the true state of affairs.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; said I,
laughing, &#8217;there is no harm done except that
you puzzled me terribly; so if you, sir, would kindly
step into the waiting-room I shall be happy to continue
our consultation which was brought to so abrupt an
ending.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;For half an hour or
so I discussed that old gentleman&#8217;s symptoms
with him, and then, having prescribed for him, I saw
him go off upon the arm of his son.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have told you that Mr. Blessington
generally chose this hour of the day for his exercise.&#160;
He came in shortly afterwards and passed upstairs.&#160;
An instant later I heard him running down, and he burst
into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with
panic.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Who has been in my room?&#8217; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No one,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;It&#8217;s a lie!&#160; He yelled.&#160;
&#8216;Come up and look!&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I passed over the grossness
of his language, as he seemed half out of his mind
with fear.&#160; When I went upstairs with him he pointed
to several footprints upon the light carpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;D&#8217;you mean to say those are mine?&#8217;
he cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They were certainly very much
larger than any which he could have made, and were
evidently quite fresh.&#160; It rained hard this afternoon,
as you know, and my patients were the only people
who called.&#160; It must have been the case, then,
that the man in the waiting-room had, for some unknown
reason, while I was busy with the other, ascended to
the room of my resident patient.&#160; Nothing had
been touched or taken, but there were the footprints
to prove that the intrusion was an undoubted fact.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mr. Blessington seemed more
excited over the matter than I should have thought
possible, though of course it was enough to disturb
anybody&#8217;s peace of mind.&#160; He actually sat
crying in an arm-chair, and I could hardly get him
to speak coherently.&#160; It was his suggestion that
I should come round to you, and of course I at once
saw the propriety of it, for certainly the incident
is a very singular one, though he appears to completely
overrate its importance.&#160; If you would only come
back with me in my brougham, you would at least be
able to soothe him, though I can hardly hope that
you will be able to explain this remarkable occurrence.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Sherlock Holmes had listened to this
long narrative with an intentness which showed me
that his interest was keenly aroused.&#160; His face
was as impassive as ever, but his lids had drooped
more heavily over his eyes, and his smoke had curled
up more thickly from his pipe to emphasize each curious
episode in the doctor&#8217;s tale.&#160; As our visitor
concluded, Holmes sprang up without a word, handed
me my hat, picked his own from the table, and followed
Dr. Trevelyan to the door.&#160; Within a quarter of
an hour we had been dropped at the door of the physician&#8217;s
residence in Brook Street, one of those sombre, flat-faced
houses which one associates with a West-End practice.&#160;
A small page admitted us, and we began at once to
ascend the broad, well-carpeted stair.</p>

<p align="justify">But a singular interruption brought
us to a standstill.&#160; The light at the top was
suddenly whisked out, and from the darkness came a
reedy, quivering voice.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have a pistol,&#8221; it
cried.&#160; &#8220;I give you my word that I&#8217;ll
fire if you come any nearer.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This really grows outrageous,
Mr. Blessington,&#8221; cried Dr. Trevelyan.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, then it is you, doctor,&#8221;
said the voice, with a great heave of relief.&#160;
&#8220;But those other gentlemen, are they what they
pretend to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>We were conscious of a long scrutiny out of the darkness.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, yes, it&#8217;s all right,&#8221;
said the voice at last.&#160; &#8220;You can come up,
and I am sorry if my precautions have annoyed you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He relit the stair gas as he spoke,
and we saw before us a singular-looking man, whose
appearance, as well as his voice, testified to his
jangled nerves.&#160; He was very fat, but had apparently
at some time been much fatter, so that the skin hung
about his face in loose pouches, like the cheeks of
a blood-hound.&#160; He was of a sickly color, and his
thin, sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the intensity
of his emotion.&#160; In his hand he held a pistol,
but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Good-evening, Mr. Holmes,&#8221;
said he.&#160; &#8220;I am sure I am very much obliged
to you for coming round.&#160; No one ever needed your
advice more than I do.&#160; I suppose that Dr. Trevelyan
has told you of this most unwarrantable intrusion
into my rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; said Holmes.&#160;
&#8220;Who are these two men Mr. Blessington, and why
do they wish to molest you?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said the
resident patient, in a nervous fashion, &#8220;of
course it is hard to say that.&#160; You can hardly
expect me to answer that, Mr. Holmes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you don&#8217;t know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in here, if you please.&#160; Just have
the kindness to step in here.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He led the way into his bedroom, which
was large and comfortably furnished.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You see that,&#8221; said he,
pointing to a big black box at the end of his bed.&#160;
&#8220;I have never been a very rich man, Mr. Holmes&#8212;&#173;never
made but one investment in my life, as Dr. Trevelyan
would tell you.&#160; But I don&#8217;t believe in
bankers.&#160; I would never trust a banker, Mr. Holmes.&#160;
Between ourselves, what little I have is in that box,
so you can understand what it means to me when unknown
people force themselves into my rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes looked at Blessington in his
questioning way and shook his head.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot possibly advise you
if you try to deceive me,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have told you everything.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes turned on his heel with a gesture
of disgust.&#160; &#8220;Good-night, Dr. Trevelyan,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;And no advice for me?&#8221;
cried Blessington, in a breaking voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;My advice to you, sir, is to speak the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A minute later we were in the street
and walking for home.&#160; We had crossed Oxford Street
and were half way down Harley Street before I could
get a word from my companion.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Sorry to bring you out on such
a fool&#8217;s errand, Watson,&#8221; he said at last.&#160;
&#8220;It is an interesting case, too, at the bottom
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can make little of it,&#8221; I confessed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, it is quite evident that
there are two men&#8212;&#173;more, perhaps, but at
least two&#8212;&#173;who are determined for some reason
to get at this fellow Blessington.&#160; I have no
doubt in my mind that both on the first and on the
second occasion that young man penetrated to Blessington&#8217;s
room, while his confederate, by an ingenious device,
kept the doctor from interfering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the catalepsy?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A fraudulent imitation, Watson,
though I should hardly dare to hint as much to our
specialist.&#160; It is a very easy complaint to imitate.&#160;
I have done it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By the purest chance Blessington
was out on each occasion.&#160; Their reason for choosing
so unusual an hour for a consultation was obviously
to insure that there should be no other patient in
the waiting-room.&#160; It just happened, however,
that this hour coincided with Blessington&#8217;s
constitutional, which seems to show that they were
not very well acquainted with his daily routine.&#160;
Of course, if they had been merely after plunder they
would at least have made some attempt to search for
it.&#160; Besides, I can read in a man&#8217;s eye when
it is his own skin that he is frightened for.&#160;
It is inconceivable that this fellow could have made
two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without
knowing of it.&#160; I hold it, therefore, to be certain
that he does know who these men are, and that for
reasons of his own he suppresses it.&#160; It is just
possible that to-morrow may find him in a more communicative
mood.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Is there not one alternative,&#8221;
I suggested, &#8220;grotesquely improbably, no doubt,
but still just conceivable?&#160; Might the whole story
of the cataleptic Russian and his son be a concoction
of Dr. Trevelyan&#8217;s, who has, for his own purposes,
been in Blessington&#8217;s rooms?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I saw in the gaslight that Holmes
wore an amused smile at this brilliant departure of
mine.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;it was one of the first solutions which
occurred to me, but I was soon able to corroborate
the doctor&#8217;s tale.&#160; This young man has left
prints upon the stair-carpet which made it quite superfluous
for me to ask to see those which he had made in the
room.&#160; When I tell you that his shoes were square-toed
instead of being pointed like Blessington&#8217;s,
and were quite an inch and a third longer than the
doctor&#8217;s, you will acknowledge that there can
be no doubt as to his individuality.&#160; But we may
sleep on it now, for I shall be surprised if we do
not hear something further from Brook Street in the
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s prophecy was
soon fulfilled, and in a dramatic fashion.&#160; At
half-past seven next morning, in the first glimmer
of daylight, I found him standing by my bedside in
his dressing-gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a brougham waiting for us, Watson,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Brook Street business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any fresh news?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Tragic, but ambiguous,&#8221;
said he, pulling up the blind.&#160; &#8220;Look at
this&#8212;&#173;a sheet from a note-book, with &#8216;For
God&#8217;s sake come at once&#8212;&#173;P.&#160; T.,&#8217;
scrawled upon it in pencil.&#160; Our friend, the doctor,
was hard put to it when he wrote this.&#160; Come along,
my dear fellow, for it&#8217;s an urgent call.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">In a quarter of an hour or so we were
back at the physician&#8217;s house.&#160; He came
running out to meet us with a face of horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, such a business!&#8221; he cried, with
his hands to his temples.</p>

<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blessington has committed suicide!&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes whistled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he hanged himself during the night.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We had entered, and the doctor had
preceded us into what was evidently his waiting-room.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I really hardly know what I
am doing,&#8221; he cried.&#160; &#8220;The police are
already upstairs.&#160; It has shaken me most dreadfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you find it out?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He has a cup of tea taken in
to him early every morning.&#160; When the maid entered,
about seven, there the unfortunate fellow was hanging
in the middle of the room.&#160; He had tied his cord
to the hook on which the heavy lamp used to hang,
and he had jumped off from the top of the very box
that he showed us yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes stood for a moment in deep thought.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;With your permission,&#8221;
said he at last, &#8220;I should like to go upstairs
and look into the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>We both ascended, followed by the doctor.</p>

<p align="justify">It was a dreadful sight which met
us as we entered the bedroom door.&#160; I have spoken
of the impression of flabbiness which this man Blessington
conveyed.&#160; As he dangled from the hook it was exaggerated
and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance.&#160;
The neck was drawn out like a plucked chicken&#8217;s,
making the rest of him seem the more obese and unnatural
by the contrast.&#160; He was clad only in his long
night-dress, and his swollen ankles and ungainly feet
protruded starkly from beneath it.&#160; Beside him
stood a smart-looking police-inspector, who was taking
notes in a pocket-book.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said
he, heartily, as my friend entered, &#8220;I am delighted
to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Good-morning, Lanner,&#8221;
answered Holmes; &#8220;you won&#8217;t think me an
intruder, I am sure.&#160; Have you heard of the events
which led up to this affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard something of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you formed any opinion?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;As far as I can see, the man
has been driven out of his senses by fright.&#160;
The bed has been well slept in, you see.&#160; There&#8217;s
his impression deep enough.&#160; It&#8217;s about
five in the morning, you know, that suicides are most
common.&#160; That would be about his time for hanging
himself.&#160; It seems to have been a very deliberate
affair.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I should say that he has been
dead about three hours, judging by the rigidity of
the muscles,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noticed anything peculiar about the room?&#8221;
asked Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Found a screw-driver and some
screws on the wash-hand stand.&#160; Seems to have
smoked heavily during the night, too.&#160; Here are
four cigar-ends that I picked out of the fireplace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum!&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;have you got
his cigar-holder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I have seen none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His cigar-case, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was in his coat-pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes opened it and smelled the single cigar which
it contained.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, this is an Havana, and
these others are cigars of the peculiar sort which
are imported by the Dutch from their East Indian colonies.&#160;
They are usually wrapped in straw, you know, and are
thinner for their length than any other brand.&#8221;&#160;
He picked up the four ends and examined them with
his pocket-lens.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Two of these have been smoked
from a holder and two without,&#8221; said he.&#160;
&#8220;Two have been cut by a not very sharp knife,
and two have had the ends bitten off by a set of excellent
teeth.&#160; This is no suicide, Mr. Lanner.&#160; It
is a very deeply planned and cold-blooded murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; cried the inspector.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Why should any one murder a
man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what we have to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could they get in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Through the front door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was barred in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it was barred after them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I saw their traces.&#160; Excuse
me a moment, and I may be able to give you some further
information about it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He went over to the door, and turning
the lock he examined it in his methodical way.&#160;
Then he took out the key, which was on the inside,
and inspected that also.&#160; The bed, the carpet,
the chairs the mantelpiece, the dead body, and the
rope were each in turn examined, until at last he
professed himself satisfied, and with my aid and that
of the inspector cut down the wretched object and
laid it reverently under a sheet.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about this rope?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is cut off this,&#8221;
said Dr. Trevelyan, drawing a large coil from under
the bed.&#160; &#8220;He was morbidly nervous of fire,
and always kept this beside him, so that he might
escape by the window in case the stairs were burning.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That must have saved them trouble,&#8221;
said Holmes, thoughtfully.&#160; &#8220;Yes, the actual
facts are very plain, and I shall be surprised if by
the afternoon I cannot give you the reasons for them
as well.&#160; I will take this photograph of Blessington,
which I see upon the mantelpiece, as it may help me
in my inquiries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have told us nothing!&#8221; cried
the doctor.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, there can be no doubt as
to the sequence of events,&#8221; said Holmes.&#160;
&#8220;There were three of them in it:&#160; the young
man, the old man, and a third, to whose identity I
have no clue.&#160; The first two, I need hardly remark,
are the same who masqueraded as the Russian count and
his son, so we can give a very full description of
them.&#160; They were admitted by a confederate inside
the house.&#160; If I might offer you a word of advice,
Inspector, it would be to arrest the page, who, as
I understand, has only recently come into your service,
Doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The young imp cannot be found,&#8221;
said Dr. Trevelyan; &#8220;the maid and the cook have
just been searching for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He has played a not unimportant
part in this drama,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;The
three men having ascended the stairs, which they did
on tiptoe, the elder man first, the younger man second,
and the unknown man in the rear&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Holmes!&#8221; I ejaculated.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, there could be no question
as to the superimposing of the footmarks.&#160; I had
the advantage of learning which was which last night.&#160;
They ascended, then, to Mr. Blessington&#8217;s room,
the door of which they found to be locked.&#160; With
the help of a wire, however, they forced round the
key.&#160; Even without the lens you will perceive,
by the scratches on this ward, where the pressure
was applied.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;On entering the room their
first proceeding must have been to gag Mr. Blessington.&#160;
He may have been asleep, or he may have been so paralyzed
with terror as to have been unable to cry out.&#160;
These walls are thick, and it is conceivable that
his shriek, if he had time to utter one, was unheard.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Having secured him, it is evident
to me that a consultation of some sort was held.&#160;
Probably it was something in the nature of a judicial
proceeding.&#160; It must have lasted for some time,
for it was then that these cigars were smoked.&#160;
The older man sat in that wicker chair; it was he
who used the cigar-holder.&#160; The younger man sat
over yonder; he knocked his ash off against the chest
of drawers.&#160; The third fellow paced up and down.&#160;
Blessington, I think, sat upright in the bed, but of
that I cannot be absolutely certain.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, it ended by their taking
Blessington and hanging him.&#160; The matter was so
prearranged that it is my belief that they brought
with them some sort of block or pulley which might
serve as a gallows.&#160; That screw-driver and those
screws were, as I conceive, for fixing it up.&#160;
Seeing the hook, however they naturally saved themselves
the trouble.&#160; Having finished their work they
made off, and the door was barred behind them by their
confederate.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We had all listened with the deepest
interest to this sketch of the night&#8217;s doings,
which Holmes had deduced from signs so subtle and minute
that, even when he had pointed them out to us, we could
scarcely follow him in his reasoning.&#160; The inspector
hurried away on the instant to make inquiries about
the page, while Holmes and I returned to Baker Street
for breakfast.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back by three,&#8221;
said he, when we had finished our meal.&#160; &#8220;Both
the inspector and the doctor will meet me here at that
hour, and I hope by that time to have cleared up any
little obscurity which the case may still present.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Our visitors arrived at the appointed
time, but it was a quarter to four before my friend
put in an appearance.&#160; From his expression as he
entered, however, I could see that all had gone well
with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any news, Inspector?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have got the boy, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent, and I have got the men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have got them!&#8221; we cried, all three.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, at least I have got their
identity.&#160; This so-called Blessington is, as I
expected, well known at headquarters, and so are his
assailants.&#160; Their names are Biddle, Hayward, and
Moffat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Worthingdon bank gang,&#8221; cried the
inspector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; said Holmes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Blessington must have been Sutton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Holmes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that makes it as clear as crystal,&#8221;
said the inspector.</p>

<p>But Trevelyan and I looked at each other in bewilderment.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You must surely remember the
great Worthingdon bank business,&#8221; said Holmes.&#160;
&#8220;Five men were in it&#8212;&#173;these four and
a fifth called Cartwright.&#160; Tobin, the care-taker,
was murdered, and the thieves got away with seven
thousand pounds.&#160; This was in 1875.&#160; They were
all five arrested, but the evidence against them was
by no means conclusive.&#160; This Blessington or Sutton,
who was the worst of the gang, turned informer.&#160;
On his evidence Cartwright was hanged and the other
three got fifteen years apiece.&#160; When they got
out the other day, which was some years before their
full term, they set themselves, as you perceive, to
hunt down the traitor and to avenge the death of their
comrade upon him.&#160; Twice they tried to get at
him and failed; a third time, you see, it came off.&#160;
Is there anything further which I can explain, Dr.
Trevelyan?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I think you have made it all
remarkable clear,&#8221; said the doctor.&#160; &#8220;No
doubt the day on which he was perturbed was the day
when he had seen of their release in the newspapers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so.&#160; His talk about a burglary was
the merest blind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why could he not tell you this?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, my dear sir, knowing
the vindictive character of his old associates, he
was trying to hide his own identity from everybody
as long as he could.&#160; His secret was a shameful
one, and he could not bring himself to divulge it.&#160;
However, wretch as he was, he was still living under
the shield of British law, and I have no doubt, Inspector,
that you will see that, though that shield may fail
to guard, the sword of justice is still there to avenge.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Such were the singular circumstances
in connection with the Resident Patient and the Brook
Street Doctor.&#160; From that night nothing has been
seen of the three murderers by the police, and it is
surmised at Scotland Yard that they were among the
passengers of the ill-fated steamer Norah Creina,
which was lost some years ago with all hands upon
the Portuguese coast, some leagues to the north of
Oporto.&#160; The proceedings against the page broke
down for want of evidence, and the Brook Street Mystery,
as it was called, has never until now been fully dealt
with in any public print.</p>

<mbp:pagebreak />
<h1>Adventure IX.&#160; The Greek Interpreter</h1>

<p align="justify">During my long and intimate acquaintance
with Mr. Sherlock Holmes I had never heard him refer
to his relations, and hardly ever to his own early
life.&#160; This reticence upon his part had increased
the somewhat inhuman effect which he produced upon
me, until sometimes I found myself regarding him as
an isolated phenomenon, a brain without a heart, as
deficient in human sympathy as he was pre-eminent in
intelligence.&#160; His aversion to women and his disinclination
to form new friendships were both typical of his unemotional
character, but not more so than his complete suppression
of every reference to his own people.&#160; I had come
to believe that he was an orphan with no relatives
living, but one day, to my very great surprise, he
began to talk to me about his brother.</p>

<p align="justify">It was after tea on a summer evening,
and the conversation, which had roamed in a desultory,
spasmodic fashion from golf clubs to the causes of
the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, came round
at last to the question of atavism and hereditary
aptitudes.&#160; The point under discussion was, how
far any singular gift in an individual was due to
his ancestry and how far to his own early training.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In your own case,&#8221; said
I, &#8220;from all that you have told me, it seems
obvious that your faculty of observation and your peculiar
facility for deduction are due to your own systematic
training.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;To some extent,&#8221; he answered,
thoughtfully.&#160; &#8220;My ancestors were country
squires, who appear to have led much the same life
as is natural to their class.&#160; But, none the less,
my turn that way is in my veins, and may have come
with my grandmother, who was the sister of Vernet,
the French artist.&#160; Art in the blood is liable
to take the strangest forms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how do you know that it is hereditary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because my brother Mycroft possesses it in
a larger degree than I do.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">This was news to me indeed.&#160; If
there were another man with such singular powers in
England, how was it that neither police nor public
had heard of him?&#160; I put the question, with a
hint that it was my companion&#8217;s modesty which
made him acknowledge his brother as his superior.&#160;
Holmes laughed at my suggestion.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear Watson,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;I cannot agree with those who rank modesty
among the virtues.&#160; To the logician all things
should be seen exactly as they are, and to underestimate
one&#8217;s self is as much a departure from truth
as to exaggerate one&#8217;s own powers.&#160; When
I say, therefore, that Mycroft has better powers of
observation than I, you may take it that I am speaking
the exact and literal truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he your junior?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven years my senior.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How comes it that he is unknown?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is very well known in his own circle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in the Diogenes Club, for example.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had never heard of the institution,
and my face must have proclaimed as much, for Sherlock
Holmes pulled out his watch.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The Diogenes Club is the queerest
club in London, and Mycroft one of the queerest men.&#160;
He&#8217;s always there from quarter to five to twenty
to eight.&#160; It&#8217;s six now, so if you care
for a stroll this beautiful evening I shall be very
happy to introduce you to two curiosities.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Five minutes later we were in the
street, walking towards Regent&#8217;s Circus.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You wonder,&#8221; said my
companion, &#8220;why it is that Mycroft does not use
his powers for detective work.&#160; He is incapable
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I thought you said&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I said that he was my superior
in observation and deduction.&#160; If the art of the
detective began and ended in reasoning from an arm-chair,
my brother would be the greatest criminal agent that
ever lived.&#160; But he has no ambition and no energy.&#160;
He will not even go out of his way to verify his own
solutions, and would rather be considered wrong than
take the trouble to prove himself right.&#160; Again
and again I have taken a problem to him, and have
received an explanation which has afterwards proved
to be the correct one.&#160; And yet he was absolutely
incapable of working out the practical points which
must be gone into before a case could be laid before
a judge or jury.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not his profession, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By no means.&#160; What is to
me a means of livelihood is to him the merest hobby
of a dilettante.&#160; He has an extraordinary faculty
for figures, and audits the books in some of the government
departments.&#160; Mycroft lodges in Pall Mall, and
he walks round the corner into Whitehall every morning
and back every evening.&#160; From year&#8217;s end
to year&#8217;s end he takes no other exercise, and
is seen nowhere else, except only in the Diogenes Club,
which is just opposite his rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot recall the name.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;V&#233;ry likely not.&#160; There
are many men in London, you know, who, some from shyness,
some from misanthropy, have no wish for the company
of their fellows.&#160; Yet they are not averse to
comfortable chairs and the latest periodicals.&#160;
It is for the convenience of these that the Diogenes
Club was started, and it now contains the most unsociable
and unclubable men in town.&#160; No member is permitted
to take the least notice of any other one.&#160; Save
in the Stranger&#8217;s Room, no talking is, under
any circumstances, allowed, and three offences, if
brought to the notice of the committee, render the
talker liable to expulsion.&#160; My brother was one
of the founders, and I have myself found it a very
soothing atmosphere.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We had reached Pall Mall as we talked,
and were walking down it from the St. James&#8217;s
end.&#160; Sherlock Holmes stopped at a door some little
distance from the Carlton, and, cautioning me not
to speak, he led the way into the hall.&#160; Through
the glass paneling I caught a glimpse of a large and
luxurious room, in which a considerable number of men
were sitting about and reading papers, each in his
own little nook.&#160; Holmes showed me into a small
chamber which looked out into Pall Mall, and then,
leaving me for a minute, he came back with a companion
whom I knew could only be his brother.</p>

<p align="justify">Mycroft Holmes was a much larger and
stouter man than Sherlock.&#160; His body was absolutely
corpulent, but his face, though massive, had preserved
something of the sharpness of expression which was
so remarkable in that of his brother.&#160; His eyes,
which were of a peculiarly light, watery gray, seemed
to always retain that far-away, introspective look
which I had only observed in Sherlock&#8217;s when
he was exerting his full powers.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am glad to meet you, sir,&#8221;
said he, putting out a broad, fat hand like the flipper
of a seal.&#160; &#8220;I hear of Sherlock everywhere
since you became his chronicler.&#160; By the way,
Sherlock, I expected to see you round last week, to
consult me over that Manor House case.&#160; I thought
you might be a little out of your depth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I solved it,&#8221; said my friend, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Adams, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was Adams.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I was sure of it from the first.&#8221;&#160;
The two sat down together in the bow-window of the
club.&#160; &#8220;To any one who wishes to study mankind
this is the spot,&#8221; said Mycroft.&#160; &#8220;Look
at the magnificent types!&#160; Look at these two men
who are coming towards us, for example.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The billiard-marker and the other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#160; What do you make of the other?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The two men had stopped opposite the
window.&#160; Some chalk marks over the waistcoat pocket
were the only signs of billiards which I could see
in one of them.&#160; The other was a very small, dark
fellow, with his hat pushed back and several packages
under his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;An old soldier, I perceive,&#8221; said Sherlock.</p>

<p>&#8220;And very recently discharged,&#8221; remarked
the brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Served in India, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a non-commissioned officer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Royal Artillery, I fancy,&#8221; said Sherlock.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a widower.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But with a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Children, my dear boy, children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said I, laughing, &#8220;this
is a little too much.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Surely,&#8221; answered Holmes,
&#8220;it is not hard to say that a man with that
bearing, expression of authority, and sunbaked skin,
is a soldier, is more than a private, and is not long
from India.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That he has not left the service
long is shown by his still wearing his ammunition
boots, as they are called,&#8221; observed Mycroft.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He had not the cavalry stride,
yet he wore his hat on one side, as is shown by the
lighter skin of that side of his brow.&#160; His weight
is against his being a sapper.&#160; He is in the artillery.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then, of course, his complete
mourning shows that he has lost some one very dear.&#160;
The fact that he is doing his own shopping looks as
though it were his wife.&#160; He has been buying things
for children, you perceive.&#160; There is a rattle,
which shows that one of them is very young.&#160; The
wife probably died in childbed.&#160; The fact that
he has a picture-book under his arm shows that there
is another child to be thought of.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I began to understand what my friend
meant when he said that his brother possessed even
keener faculties that he did himself.&#160; He glanced
across at me and smiled.&#160; Mycroft took snuff from
a tortoise-shell box, and brushed away the wandering
grains from his coat front with a large, red silk
handkerchief.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By the way, Sherlock,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I have had something quite after your
own heart&#8212;&#173;a most singular problem&#8212;&#173;submitted
to my judgment.&#160; I really had not the energy to
follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion, but
it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation.&#160;
If you would care to hear the facts&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mycroft, I should be delighted.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The brother scribbled a note upon
a leaf of his pocket-book, and, ringing the bell,
he handed it to the waiter.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have asked Mr. Melas to step
across,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;He lodges on the
floor above me, and I have some slight acquaintance
with him, which led him to come to me in his perplexity.&#160;
Mr. Melas is a Greek by extraction, as I understand,
and he is a remarkable linguist.&#160; He earns his
living partly as interpreter in the law courts and
partly by acting as guide to any wealthy <i>Orientals</i>
who may visit the Northumberland Avenue hotels.&#160;
I think I will leave him to tell his very remarkable
experience in his own fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A few minutes later we were joined
by a short, stout man whose olive face and coal-black
hair proclaimed his Southern origin, though his speech
was that of an educated Englishman.&#160; He shook hands
eagerly with Sherlock Holmes, and his dark eyes sparkled
with pleasure when he understood that the specialist
was anxious to hear his story.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I do not believe that the police
credit me&#8212;&#173;on my word, I do not,&#8221; said
he in a wailing voice.&#160; &#8220;Just because they
have never heard of it before, they think that such
a thing cannot be.&#160; But I know that I shall never
be easy in my mind until I know what has become of
my poor man with the sticking-plaster upon his face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am all attention,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This is Wednesday evening,&#8221;
said Mr. Melas.&#160; &#8220;Well then, it was Monday
night&#8212;&#173;only two days ago, you understand&#8212;&#173;that
all this happened.&#160; I am an interpreter, as perhaps
my neighbor there has told you.&#160; I interpret all
languages&#8212;&#173;or nearly all&#8212;&#173;but as
I am a Greek by birth and with a Grecian name, it
is with that particular tongue that I am principally
associated.&#160; For many years I have been the chief
Greek interpreter in London, and my name is very well
known in the hotels.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It happens not unfrequently
that I am sent for at strange hours by foreigners
who get into difficulties, or by travelers who arrive
late and wish my services.&#160; I was not surprised,
therefore, on Monday night when a Mr. Latimer, a very
fashionably dressed young man, came up to my rooms
and asked me to accompany him in a cab which was waiting
at the door.&#160; A Greek friend had come to see him
upon business, he said, and as he could speak nothing
but his own tongue, the services of an interpreter
were indispensable.&#160; He gave me to understand that
his house was some little distance off, in Kensington,
and he seemed to be in a great hurry, bustling me
rapidly into the cab when we had descended to the
street.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I say into the cab, but I soon
became doubtful as to whether it was not a carriage
in which I found myself.&#160; It was certainly more
roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to London,
and the fittings, though frayed, were of rich quality.&#160;
Mr. Latimer seated himself opposite to me and we started
off through Charing Cross and up the Shaftesbury Avenue.&#160;
We had come out upon Oxford Street and I had ventured
some remark as to this being a roundabout way to Kensington,
when my words were arrested by the extraordinary conduct
of my companion.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He began by drawing a most
formidable-looking bludgeon loaded with lead from
his pocket, and switching it backward and forward several
times, as if to test its weight and strength.&#160;
Then he placed it without a word upon the seat beside
him.&#160; Having done this, he drew up the windows
on each side, and I found to my astonishment that
they were covered with paper so as to prevent my seeing
through them.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I am sorry to cut off
your view, Mr. Melas,&#8217; said he.&#160; &#8217;The
fact is that I have no intention that you should see
what the place is to which we are driving.&#160; It
might possibly be inconvenient to me if you could
find your way there again.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;As you can imagine, I was utterly
taken aback by such an address.&#160; My companion
was a powerful, broad-shouldered young fellow, and,
apart from the weapon, I should not have had the slightest
chance in a struggle with him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;This is very extraordinary
conduct, Mr. Latimer,&#8217; I stammered.&#160; &#8217;You
must be aware that what you are doing is quite illegal.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;It is somewhat of a
liberty, no doubt,&#8217; said he, &#8217;but we&#8217;ll
make it up to you.&#160; I must warn you, however,
Mr. Melas, that if at any time to-night you attempt
to raise an alarm or do anything which is against
my interests, you will find it a very serious thing.&#160;
I beg you to remember that no one knows where you
are, and that, whether you are in this carriage or
in my house, you are equally in my power.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;His words were quiet, but he
had a rasping way of saying them which was very menacing.&#160;
I sat in silence wondering what on earth could be
his reason for kidnapping me in this extraordinary
fashion.&#160; Whatever it might be, it was perfectly
clear that there was no possible use in my resisting,
and that I could only wait to see what might befall.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;For nearly two hours we drove
without my having the least clue as to where we were
going.&#160; Sometimes the rattle of the stones told
of a paved causeway, and at others our smooth, silent
course suggested asphalt; but, save by this variation
in sound, there was nothing at all which could in
the remotest way help me to form a guess as to where
we were.&#160; The paper over each window was impenetrable
to light, and a blue curtain was drawn across the
glass work in front.&#160; It was a quarter-past seven
when we left Pall Mall, and my watch showed me that
it was ten minutes to nine when we at last came to
a standstill.&#160; My companion let down the window,
and I caught a glimpse of a low, arched doorway with
a lamp burning above it.&#160; As I was hurried from
the carriage it swung open, and I found myself inside
the house, with a vague impression of a lawn and trees
on each side of me as I entered.&#160; Whether these
were private grounds, however, or bona-fide country
was more than I could possibly venture to say.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There was a colored gas-lamp
inside which was turned so low that I could see little
save that the hall was of some size and hung with
pictures.&#160; In the dim light I could make out that
the person who had opened the door was a small, mean-looking,
middle-aged man with rounded shoulders.&#160; As he
turned towards us the glint of the light showed me
that he was wearing glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is this Mr. Melas, Harold?&#8217; said
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Well done, well done!&#160;
No ill-will, Mr. Melas, I hope, but we could not get
on without you.&#160; If you deal fair with us you&#8217;ll
not regret it, but if you try any tricks, God help
you!&#8217; He spoke in a nervous, jerky fashion,
and with little giggling laughs in between, but somehow
he impressed me with fear more than the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What do you want with me?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Only to ask a few questions
of a Greek gentleman who is visiting us, and to let
us have the answers.&#160; But say no more than you
are told to say, or&#8212;&#173;&#8217; here came the
nervous giggle again&#8212;&#173;&#8217;you had better
never have been born.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;As he spoke he opened a door
and showed the way into a room which appeared to be
very richly furnished, but again the only light was
afforded by a single lamp half-turned down.&#160; The
chamber was certainly large, and the way in which
my feet sank into the carpet as I stepped across it
told me of its richness.&#160; I caught glimpses of
velvet chairs, a high white marble mantel-piece, and
what seemed to be a suit of Japanese armor at one
side of it.&#160; There was a chair just under the lamp,
and the elderly man motioned that I should sit in
it.&#160; The younger had left us, but he suddenly
returned through another door, leading with him a
gentleman clad in some sort of loose dressing-gown
who moved slowly towards us.&#160; As he came into
the circle of dim light which enables me to see him
more clearly I was thrilled with horror at his appearance.&#160;
He was deadly pale and terribly emaciated, with the
protruding, brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was
greater than his strength.&#160; But what shocked me
more than any signs of physical weakness was that his
face was grotesquely criss-crossed with sticking-plaster,
and that one large pad of it was fastened over his
mouth.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Have you the slate,
Harold?&#8217; cried the older man, as this strange
being fell rather than sat down into a chair.&#160;
&#8217;Are his hands loose?&#160; Now, then, give him
the pencil.&#160; You are to ask the questions, Mr.
Melas, and he will write the answers.&#160; Ask him
first of all whether he is prepared to sign the papers?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s eyes flashed fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Never!&#8217; he wrote in Greek upon
the slate.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;On no condition?&#8217; I asked, at
the bidding of our tyrant.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Only if I see her married
in my presence by a Greek priest whom I know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man giggled in his venomous way.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You know what awaits you, then?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I care nothing for myself.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;These are samples of the questions
and answers which made up our strange half-spoken,
half-written conversation.&#160; Again and again I had
to ask him whether he would give in and sign the documents.&#160;
Again and again I had the same indignant reply.&#160;
But soon a happy thought came to me.&#160; I took to
adding on little sentences of my own to each question,
innocent ones at first, to test whether either of
our companions knew anything of the matter, and then,
as I found that they showed no signs I played a more
dangerous game.&#160; Our conversation ran something
like this:&#160;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You can do no good by this obstinacy.&#160;
Who are you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I care not.&#160; I am a stranger in
London.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Your fate will be upon your own head.&#160;
How long have you been here?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let it be so.&#160; Three weeks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The property can never be yours.&#160;
What ails you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It shall not go to villains.&#160; They
are starving me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You shall go free if you sign.&#160;
What house is this?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will never sign.&#160; I do not know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are not doing her any service.&#160;
What is your name?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let me hear her say so.&#160; Kratides.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You shall see her if you sign.&#160;
Where are you from?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then I shall never see her.&#160; Athens.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Another five minutes, Mr. Holmes,
and I should have wormed out the whole story under
their very noses.&#160; My very next question might
have cleared the matter up, but at that instant the
door opened and a woman stepped into the room.&#160;
I could not see her clearly enough to know more than
that she was tall and graceful, with black hair, and
clad in some sort of loose white gown.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Harold,&#8217; said
she, speaking English with a broken accent.&#160; &#8217;I
could not stay away longer.&#160; It is so lonely up
there with only&#8212;&#173;Oh, my God, it is Paul!&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;These last words were in Greek,
and at the same instant the man with a convulsive
effort tore the plaster from his lips, and screaming
out &#8216;Sophy!&#160; Sophy!&#8217; rushed into the
woman&#8217;s arms.&#160; Their embrace was but for
an instant, however, for the younger man seized the
woman and pushed her out of the room, while the elder
easily overpowered his emaciated victim, and dragged
him away through the other door.&#160; For a moment
I was left alone in the room, and I sprang to my feet
with some vague idea that I might in some way get
a clue to what this house was in which I found myself.&#160;
Fortunately, however, I took no steps, for looking
up I saw that the older man was standing in the door-way
with his eyes fixed upon me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;That will do, Mr. Melas,&#8217;
said he.&#160; &#8217;You perceive that we have taken
you into our confidence over some very private business.&#160;
We should not have troubled you, only that our friend
who speaks Greek and who began these negotiations
has been forced to return to the East.&#160; It was
quite necessary for us to find some one to take his
place, and we were fortunate in hearing of your powers.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bowed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;There are five sovereigns
here,&#8217; said he, walking up to me, &#8217;which
will, I hope, be a sufficient fee.&#160; But remember,&#8217;
he added, tapping me lightly on the chest and giggling,
&#8217;if you speak to a human soul about this&#8212;&#173;one
human soul, mind&#8212;&#173;well, may God have mercy
upon your soul!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I cannot tell you the loathing
and horror with which this insignificant-looking man
inspired me.&#160; I could see him better now as the
lamp-light shone upon him.&#160; His features were peaky
and sallow, and his little pointed beard was thready
and ill-nourished.&#160; He pushed his face forward
as he spoke and his lips and eyelids were continually
twitching like a man with St. Vitus&#8217;s dance.&#160;
I could not help thinking that his strange, catchy
little laugh was also a symptom of some nervous malady.&#160;
The terror of his face lay in his eyes, however, steel
gray, and glistening coldly with a malignant, inexorable
cruelty in their depths.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;We shall know if you
speak of this,&#8217; said he.&#160; &#8217;We have
our own means of information.&#160; Now you will find
the carriage waiting, and my friend will see you on
your way.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I was hurried through the hall
and into the vehicle, again obtaining that momentary
glimpse of trees and a garden.&#160; Mr. Latimer followed
closely at my heels, and took his place opposite to
me without a word.&#160; In silence we again drove
for an interminable distance with the windows raised,
until at last, just after midnight, the carriage pulled
up.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You will get down here,
Mr. Melas,&#8217; said my companion.&#160; &#8217;I
am sorry to leave you so far from your house, but
there is no alternative.&#160; Any attempt upon your
part to follow the carriage can only end in injury
to yourself.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He opened the door as he spoke,
and I had hardly time to spring out when the coachman
lashed the horse and the carriage rattled away.&#160;
I looked around me in astonishment.&#160; I was on
some sort of a heathy common mottled over with dark
clumps of furze-bushes.&#160; Far away stretched a
line of houses, with a light here and there in the
upper windows.&#160; On the other side I saw the red
signal-lamps of a railway.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The carriage which had brought
me was already out of sight.&#160; I stood gazing round
and wondering where on earth I might be, when I saw
some one coming towards me in the darkness.&#160; As
he came up to me I made out that he was a railway
porter.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Can you tell me what place this is?&#8217;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wandsworth Common,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Can I get a train into town?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;If you walk on a mile
or so to Clapham Junction,&#8217; said he, &#8217;you&#8217;ll
just be in time for the last to Victoria.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;So that was the end of my adventure,
Mr. Holmes.&#160; I do not know where I was, nor whom
I spoke with, nor anything save what I have told you.&#160;
But I know that there is foul play going on, and I
want to help that unhappy man if I can.&#160; I told
the whole story to Mr. Mycroft Holmes next morning,
and subsequently to the police.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We all sat in silence for some little
time after listening to this extraordinary narrative.&#160;
Then Sherlock looked across at his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any steps?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Mycroft picked up the Daily News, which was lying
on the side-table.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Anybody supplying any
information to the whereabouts of a Greek gentleman
named Paul Kratides, from Athens, who is unable to
speak English, will be rewarded.&#160; A similar reward
paid to any one giving information about a Greek lady
whose first name is Sophy.&#160; X 2473.&#8217;&#160;
That was in all the dailies.&#160; No answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the Greek Legation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have inquired.&#160; They know nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A wire to the head of the Athens police, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Sherlock has all the energy
of the family,&#8221; said Mycroft, turning to me.&#160;
&#8220;Well, you take the case up by all means, and
let me know if you do any good.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; answered
my friend, rising from his chair.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
let you know, and Mr. Melas also.&#160; In the meantime,
Mr. Melas, I should certainly be on my guard, if I
were you, for of course they must know through these
advertisements that you have betrayed them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">As we walked home together, Holmes
stopped at a telegraph office and sent off several
wires.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You see, Watson,&#8221; he
remarked, &#8220;our evening has been by no means
wasted.&#160; Some of my most interesting cases have
come to me in this way through Mycroft.&#160; The problem
which we have just listened to, although it can admit
of but one explanation, has still some distinguishing
features.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have hopes of solving it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, knowing as much as we
do, it will be singular indeed if we fail to discover
the rest.&#160; You must yourself have formed some theory
which will explain the facts to which we have listened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a vague way, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was your idea, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It seemed to me to be obvious
that this Greek girl had been carried off by the young
Englishman named Harold Latimer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Carried off from where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Athens, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Sherlock Holmes shook his head.&#160;
&#8220;This young man could not talk a word of Greek.&#160;
The lady could talk English fairly well.&#160; Inference&#8212;&#173;that
she had been in England some little time, but he had
not been in Greece.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, then, we will presume
that she had come on a visit to England, and that
this Harold had persuaded her to fly with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is more probable.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then the brother&#8212;&#173;for
that, I fancy, must be the relationship&#8212;&#173;comes
over from Greece to interfere.&#160; He imprudently
puts himself into the power of the young man and his
older associate.&#160; They seize him and use violence
towards him in order to make him sign some papers to
make over the girl&#8217;s fortune&#8212;&#173;of which
he may be trustee&#8212;&#173;to them.&#160; This he
refuses to do.&#160; In order to negotiate with him
they have to get an interpreter, and they pitch upon
this Mr. Melas, having used some other one before.&#160;
The girl is not told of the arrival of her brother,
and finds it out by the merest accident.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Excellent, Watson!&#8221; cried
Holmes.&#160; &#8220;I really fancy that you are not
far from the truth.&#160; You see that we hold all
the cards, and we have only to fear some sudden act
of violence on their part.&#160; If they give us time
we must have them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can we find where this house lies?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, if our conjecture is
correct and the girl&#8217;s name is or was Sophy
Kratides, we should have no difficulty in tracing her.&#160;
That must be our main hope, for the brother is, of
course, a complete stranger.&#160; It is clear that
some time has elapsed since this Harold established
these relations with the girl&#8212;&#173;some weeks,
at any rate&#8212;&#173;since the brother in Greece
has had time to hear of it and come across.&#160; If
they have been living in the same place during this
time, it is probable that we shall have some answer
to Mycroft&#8217;s advertisement.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We had reached our house in Baker
Street while we had been talking.&#160; Holmes ascended
the stair first, and as he opened the door of our room
he gave a start of surprise.&#160; Looking over his
shoulder, I was equally astonished.&#160; His brother
Mycroft was sitting smoking in the arm-chair.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Come in, Sherlock!&#160; Come
in, sir,&#8221; said he blandly, smiling at our surprised
faces.&#160; &#8220;You don&#8217;t expect such energy
from me, do you, Sherlock?&#160; But somehow this case
attracts me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I passed you in a hansom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been some new development?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had an answer to my advertisement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it came within a few minutes of your leaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to what effect?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mycroft Holmes took out a sheet of paper.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;written with a J pen on royal cream paper by
a middle-aged man with a weak constitution.&#160; &#8216;Sir,&#8217;
he says, &#8217;in answer to your advertisement of
to-day&#8217;s date, I beg to inform you that I know
the young lady in question very well.&#160; If you
should care to call upon me I could give you some
particulars as to her painful history.&#160; She is
living at present at The Myrtles, Beckenham.&#160;
Yours faithfully, J. Davenport.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He writes from Lower Brixton,&#8221;
said Mycroft Holmes.&#160; &#8220;Do you not think
that we might drive to him now, Sherlock, and learn
these particulars?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear Mycroft, the brother&#8217;s
life is more valuable than the sister&#8217;s story.&#160;
I think we should call at Scotland Yard for Inspector
Gregson, and go straight out to Beckenham.&#160; We
know that a man is being done to death, and every
hour may be vital.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Better pick up Mr. Melas on
our way,&#8221; I suggested.&#160; &#8220;We may need
an interpreter.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; said Sherlock
Holmes.&#160; &#8220;Send the boy for a four-wheeler,
and we shall be off at once.&#8221;&#160; He opened
the table-drawer as he spoke, and I noticed that he
slipped his revolver into his pocket.&#160; &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
said he, in answer to my glance; &#8220;I should say
from what we have heard, that we are dealing with
a particularly dangerous gang.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It was almost dark before we found
ourselves in Pall Mall, at the rooms of Mr. Melas.&#160;
A gentleman had just called for him, and he was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me where?&#8221; asked Mycroft
Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir,&#8221;
answered the woman who had opened the door; &#8220;I
only know that he drove away with the gentleman in
a carriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the gentleman give a name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t a tall, handsome, dark young
man?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, no, sir.&#160; He was a
little gentleman, with glasses, thin in the face,
but very pleasant in his ways, for he was laughing
all the time that he was talking.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Come along!&#8221; cried Sherlock
Holmes, abruptly.&#160; &#8220;This grows serious,&#8221;
he observed, as we drove to Scotland Yard.&#160; &#8220;These
men have got hold of Melas again.&#160; He is a man
of no physical courage, as they are well aware from
their experience the other night.&#160; This villain
was able to terrorize him the instant that he got
into his presence.&#160; No doubt they want his professional
services, but, having used him, they may be inclined
to punish him for what they will regard as his treachery.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Our hope was that, by taking train,
we might get to Beckenham as soon or sooner than the
carriage.&#160; On reaching Scotland Yard, however,
it was more than an hour before we could get Inspector
Gregson and comply with the legal formalities which
would enable us to enter the house.&#160; It was a
quarter to ten before we reached London Bridge, and
half past before the four of us alighted on the Beckenham
platform.&#160; A drive of half a mile brought us to
The Myrtles&#8212;&#173;a large, dark house standing
back from the road in its own grounds.&#160; Here we
dismissed our cab, and made our way up the drive together.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The windows are all dark,&#8221;
remarked the inspector.&#160; &#8220;The house seems
deserted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our birds are flown and the nest empty,&#8221;
said Holmes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say so?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A carriage heavily loaded with
luggage has passed out during the last hour.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The inspector laughed.&#160; &#8220;I
saw the wheel-tracks in the light of the gate-lamp,
but where does the luggage come in?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You may have observed the same
wheel-tracks going the other way.&#160; But the outward-bound
ones were very much deeper&#8212;&#173;so much so that
we can say for a certainty that there was a very considerable
weight on the carriage.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You get a trifle beyond me
there,&#8221; said the inspector, shrugging his shoulder.&#160;
&#8220;It will not be an easy door to force, but we
will try if we cannot make some one hear us.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He hammered loudly at the knocker
and pulled at the bell, but without any success.&#160;
Holmes had slipped away, but he came back in a few
minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a window open,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is a mercy that you are
on the side of the force, and not against it, Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; remarked the inspector, as he noted
the clever way in which my friend had forced back
the catch.&#160; &#8220;Well, I think that under the
circumstances we may enter without an invitation.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">One after the other we made our way
into a large apartment, which was evidently that in
which Mr. Melas had found himself.&#160; The inspector
had lit his lantern, and by its light we could see
the two doors, the curtain, the lamp, and the suit
of Japanese mail as he had described them.&#160; On
the table lay two glasses, and empty brandy-bottle,
and the remains of a meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Holmes, suddenly.</p>

<p align="justify">We all stood still and listened.&#160;
A low moaning sound was coming from somewhere over
our heads.&#160; Holmes rushed to the door and out into
the hall.&#160; The dismal noise came from upstairs.&#160;
He dashed up, the inspector and I at his heels, while
his brother Mycroft followed as quickly as his great
bulk would permit.</p>

<p align="justify">Three doors faced up upon the second
floor, and it was from the central of these that the
sinister sounds were issuing, sinking sometimes into
a dull mumble and rising again into a shrill whine.&#160;
It was locked, but the key had been left on the outside.&#160;
Holmes flung open the door and rushed in, but he was
out again in an instant, with his hand to his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s charcoal,&#8221; he cried.&#160;
&#8220;Give it time.&#160; It will clear.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Peering in, we could see that the
only light in the room came from a dull blue flame
which flickered from a small brass tripod in the centre.&#160;
It threw a livid, unnatural circle upon the floor,
while in the shadows beyond we saw the vague loom
of two figures which crouched against the wall.&#160;
From the open door there reeked a horrible poisonous
exhalation which set us gasping and coughing.&#160;
Holmes rushed to the top of the stairs to draw in
the fresh air, and then, dashing into the room, he
threw up the window and hurled the brazen tripod out
into the garden.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We can enter in a minute,&#8221;
he gasped, darting out again.&#160; &#8220;Where is
a candle?&#160; I doubt if we could strike a match
in that atmosphere.&#160; Hold the light at the door
and we shall get them out, Mycroft, now!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">With a rush we got to the poisoned
men and dragged them out into the well-lit hall.&#160;
Both of them were blue-lipped and insensible, with
swollen, congested faces and protruding eyes.&#160;
Indeed, so distorted were their features that, save
for his black beard and stout figure, we might have
failed to recognize in one of them the Greek interpreter
who had parted from us only a few hours before at
the Diogenes Club.&#160; His hands and feet were securely
strapped together, and he bore over one eye the marks
of a violent blow.&#160; The other, who was secured
in a similar fashion, was a tall man in the last stage
of emaciation, with several strips of sticking-plaster
arranged in a grotesque pattern over his face.&#160;
He had ceased to moan as we laid him down, and a glance
showed me that for him at least our aid had come too
late.&#160; Mr. Melas, however, still lived, and in
less than an hour, with the aid of ammonia and brandy
I had the satisfaction of seeing him open his eyes,
and of knowing that my hand had drawn him back from
that dark valley in which all paths meet.</p>

<p align="justify">It was a simple story which he had
to tell, and one which did but confirm our own deductions.&#160;
His visitor, on entering his rooms, had drawn a life-preserver
from his sleeve, and had so impressed him with the
fear of instant and inevitable death that he had kidnapped
him for the second time.&#160; Indeed, it was almost
mesmeric, the effect which this giggling ruffian had
produced upon the unfortunate linguist, for he could
not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched
cheek.&#160; He had been taken swiftly to Beckenham,
and had acted as interpreter in a second interview,
even more dramatic than the first, in which the two
Englishmen had menaced their prisoner with instant
death if he did not comply with their demands.&#160;
Finally, finding him proof against every threat, they
had hurled him back into his prison, and after reproaching
Melas with his treachery, which appeared from the newspaper
advertisement, they had stunned him with a blow from
a stick, and he remembered nothing more until he found
us bending over him.</p>

<p align="justify">And this was the singular case of
the Grecian Interpreter, the explanation of which
is still involved in some mystery.&#160; We were able
to find out, by communicating with the gentleman who
had answered the advertisement, that the unfortunate
young lady came of a wealthy Grecian family, and that
she had been on a visit to some friends in England.&#160;
While there she had met a young man named Harold Latimer,
who had acquired an ascendancy over he and had eventually
persuaded her to fly with him.&#160; Her friends, shocked
at the event, had contented themselves with informing
her brother at Athens, and had then washed their hands
of the matter.&#160; The brother, on his arrival in
England, had imprudently placed himself in the power
of Latimer and of his associate, whose name was Wilson
Kemp&#8212;&#173;a man of the foulest antecedents.&#160;
These two, finding that through his ignorance of the
language he was helpless in their hands, had kept
him a prisoner, and had endeavored by cruelty and
starvation to make him sign away his own and his sister&#8217;s
property.&#160; They had kept him in the house without
the girl&#8217;s knowledge, and the plaster over the
face had been for the purpose of making recognition
difficult in case she should ever catch a glimpse
of him.&#160; Her feminine perception, however, had
instantly seen through the disguise when, on the occasion
of the <i>interpr&#233;ter&#8217;s</i> <i>visit</i>, she had
seen him for the first time.&#160; The poor girl, however,
was herself a prisoner, for there was no one about
the house except the man who acted as coachman, and
his wife, both of whom were tools of the conspirators.&#160;
Finding that their secret was out, and that their
prisoner was not to be coerced, the two villains with
the girl had fled away at a few hours&#8217; notice
from the furnished house which they had hired, having
first, as they thought, taken vengeance both upon
the man who had defied and the one who had betrayed
them.</p>

<p align="justify">Months afterwards a curious newspaper
cutting reached us from Buda-Pesth.&#160; It told how
two Englishmen who had been traveling with a woman
had met with a tragic end.&#160; They had each been
stabbed, it seems, and the Hungarian police were of
opinion that they had quarreled and had inflicted
mortal injuries upon each other.&#160; Holmes, however,
is, I fancy, of a different way of thinking, and holds
to this day that, if one could find the Grecian girl,
one might learn how the wrongs of herself and her
brother came to be avenged.</p>

<mbp:pagebreak />
<h1>Adventure X. The Naval Treaty</h1>

<p align="justify">The July which immediately succeeded
my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest,
in which I had the privilege of being associated with
Sherlock Holmes and of studying his methods.&#160; I
find them recorded in my notes under the headings
of &#8220;The Adventure of the Second Stain,&#8221;
&#8220;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty,&#8221; and
&#8220;The Adventure of the Tired Captain.&#8221;&#160;
The first of these, however, deals with interest of
such importance and implicates so many of the first
families in the kingdom that for many years it will
be impossible to make it public.&#160; No case, however,
in which Holmes was engaged has ever illustrated the
value of his analytical methods so clearly or has
impressed those who were associated with him so deeply.&#160;
I still retain an almost verbatim report of the interview
in which he demonstrated the true facts of the case
to Monsieur Dubugue of the Paris police, and Fritz
von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of Dantzig,
both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved
to be side-issues.&#160; The new century will have come,
however, before the story can be safely told.&#160;
Meanwhile I pass on to the second on my list, which
promised also at one time to be of national importance,
and was marked by several incidents which give it a
quite unique character.</p>

<p align="justify">During my school-days I had been intimately
associated with a lad named Percy Phelps, who was
of much the same age as myself, though he was two
classes ahead of me.&#160; He was a very brilliant boy,
and carried away every prize which the school had
to offer, finished his exploits by winning a scholarship
which sent him on to continue his triumphant career
at Cambridge.&#160; He was, I remember, extremely well
connected, and even when we were all little boys together
we knew that his mother&#8217;s brother was Lord Holdhurst,
the great conservative politician.&#160; This gaudy
relationship did him little good at school.&#160; On
the contrary, it seemed rather a piquant thing to
us to chevy him about the playground and hit him over
the shins with a wicket.&#160; But it was another thing
when he came out into the world.&#160; I heard vaguely
that his abilities and the influences which he commanded
had won him a good position at the Foreign Office,
and then he passed completely out of my mind until
the following letter recalled his existence:&#160;</p>

<p align="justify">Briarbrae, Woking.&#160; My dear Watson,&#8212;&#173;I
have no doubt that you can remember &#8220;Tadpole&#8221;
Phelps, who was in the fifth form when you were in
the third.&#160; It is possible even that you may have
heard that through my uncle&#8217;s influence I obtained
a good appointment at the Foreign Office, and that
I was in a situation of trust and honor until a horrible
misfortune came suddenly to blast my career.</p>

<p align="justify">There is no use writing of the details
of that dreadful event.&#160; In the event of your
acceding to my request it is probably that I shall
have to narrate them to you.&#160; I have only just
recovered from nine weeks of brain-fever, and am still
exceedingly weak.&#160; Do you think that you could
bring your friend Mr. Holmes down to see me?&#160; I
should like to have his opinion of the case, though
the authorities assure me that nothing more can be
done.&#160; Do try to bring him down, and as soon as
possible.&#160; Every minute seems an hour while I
live in this state of horrible suspense.&#160; Assure
him that if I have not asked his advice sooner it was
not because I did not appreciate his talents, but
because I have been off my head ever since the blow
fell.&#160; Now I am clear again, though I dare not
think of it too much for fear of a relapse.&#160; I
am still so weak that I have to write, as you see,
by dictating.&#160; Do try to bring him.</p>

<p>Your old school-fellow,</p>

<p>Percy Phelps.</p>

<p align="justify">There was something that touched me
as I read this letter, something pitiable in the reiterated
appeals to bring Holmes.&#160; So moved was I that
even had it been a difficult matter I should have tried
it, but of course I knew well that Holmes loved his
art, so that he was ever as ready to bring his aid
as his client could be to receive it.&#160; My wife
agreed with me that not a moment should be lost in
laying the matter before him, and so within an hour
of breakfast-time I found myself back once more in
the old rooms in Baker Street.</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes was seated at his side-table
clad in his dressing-gown, and working hard over a
chemical investigation.&#160; A large curved retort
was boiling furiously in the bluish flame of a Bunsen
burner, and the distilled drops were condensing into
a two-litre measure.&#160; My friend hardly glanced
up as I entered, and I, seeing that his investigation
must be of importance, seated myself in an arm-chair
and waited.&#160; He dipped into this bottle or that,
drawing out a few drops of each with his glass pipette,
and finally brought a test-tube containing a solution
over to the table.&#160; In his right hand he held a
slip of litmus-paper.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You come at a crisis, Watson,&#8221;
said he.&#160; &#8220;If this paper remains blue, all
is well.&#160; If it turns red, it means a man&#8217;s
life.&#8221;&#160; He dipped it into the test-tube
and it flushed at once into a dull, dirty crimson.&#160;
&#8220;Hum!&#160; I thought as much!&#8221; he cried.&#160;
&#8220;I will be at your service in an instant, Watson.&#160;
You will find tobacco in the Persian slipper.&#8221;&#160;
He turned to his desk and scribbled off several telegrams,
which were handed over to the page-boy.&#160; Then
he threw himself down into the chair opposite, and
drew up his knees until his fingers clasped round
his long, thin shins.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A very commonplace little murder,&#8221;
said he.&#160; &#8220;You&#8217;ve got something better,
I fancy.&#160; You are the stormy petrel of crime, Watson.&#160;
What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I handed him the letter, which he
read with the most concentrated attention.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It does not tell us very much,
does it?&#8221; he remarked, as he handed it back
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet the writing is of interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the writing is not his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#160; It is a woman&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s surely,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No, a woman&#8217;s, and a
woman of rare character.&#160; You see, at the commencement
of an investigation it is something to know that your
client is in close contact with some one who, for good
or evil, has an exceptional nature.&#160; My interest
is already awakened in the case.&#160; If you are ready
we will start at once for Woking, and see this diplomatist
who is in such evil case, and the lady to whom he
dictates his letters.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We were fortunate enough to catch
an early train at Waterloo, and in a little under
an hour we found ourselves among the fir-woods and
the heather of Woking.&#160; Briarbrae proved to be
a large detached house standing in extensive grounds
within a few minutes&#8217; walk of the station.&#160;
On sending in our cards we were shown into an elegantly
appointed drawing-room, where we were joined in a
few minutes by a rather stout man who received us
with much hospitality.&#160; His age may have been nearer
forty than thirty, but his cheeks were so ruddy and
his eyes so merry that he still conveyed the impression
of a plump and mischievous boy.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am so glad that you have
come,&#8221; said he, shaking our hands with effusion.&#160;
&#8220;Percy has been inquiring for you all morning.&#160;
Ah, poor old chap, he clings to any straw!&#160; His
father and his mother asked me to see you, for the
mere mention of the subject is very painful to them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We have had no details yet,&#8221;
observed Holmes.&#160; &#8220;I perceive that you are
not yourself a member of the family.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Our acquaintance looked surprised,
and then, glancing down, he began to laugh.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Of course you saw the J H monogram
on my locket,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;For a moment
I thought you had done something clever.&#160; Joseph
Harrison is my name, and as Percy is to marry my sister
Annie I shall at least be a relation by marriage.&#160;
You will find my sister in his room, for she has nursed
him hand-and-foot this two months back.&#160; Perhaps
we&#8217;d better go in at once, for I know how impatient
he is.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The chamber in which we were shown
was on the same floor as the drawing-room.&#160; It
was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a
bedroom, with flowers arranged daintily in every nook
and corner.&#160; A young man, very pale and worn,
was lying upon a sofa near the open window, through
which came the rich scent of the garden and the balmy
summer air.&#160; A woman was sitting beside him, who
rose as we entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I leave, Percy?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p align="justify">He clutched her hand to detain her.&#160;
&#8220;How are you, Watson?&#8221; said he, cordially.&#160;
&#8220;I should never have known you under that moustache,
and I dare say you would not be prepared to swear
to me.&#160; This I presume is your celebrated friend,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I introduced him in a few words, and
we both sat down.&#160; The stout young man had left
us, but his sister still remained with her hand in
that of the invalid.&#160; She was a striking-looking
woman, a little short and thick for symmetry, but
with a beautiful olive complexion, large, dark, Italian
eyes, and a wealth of deep black hair.&#160; Her rich
tints made the white face of her companion the more
worn and haggard by the contrast.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I won&#8217;t waste your time,&#8221;
said he, raising himself upon the sofa.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
plunge into the matter without further preamble.&#160;
I was a happy and successful man, Mr. Holmes, and
on the eve of being married, when a sudden and dreadful
misfortune wrecked all my prospects in life.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I was, as Watson may have told
you, in the Foreign Office, and through the influences
of my uncle, Lord Holdhurst, I rose rapidly to a responsible
position.&#160; When my uncle became foreign minister
in this administration he gave me several missions
of trust, and as I always brought them to a successful
conclusion, he came at last to have the utmost confidence
in my ability and tact.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Nearly ten weeks ago&#8212;&#173;to
be more accurate, on the 23d of May&#8212;&#173;he called
me into his private room, and, after complimenting
me on the good work which I had done, he informed
me that he had a new commission of trust for me to
execute.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;This,&#8217; said he,
taking a gray roll of paper from his bureau, &#8217;is
the original of that secret treaty between England
and Italy of which, I regret to say, some rumors have
already got into the public press.&#160; It is of enormous
importance that nothing further should leak out.&#160;
The French or the Russian embassy would pay an immense
sum to learn the contents of these papers.&#160; They
should not leave my bureau were it not that it is
absolutely necessary to have them copied.&#160; You
have a desk in your office?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;Then take the treaty
and lock it up there.&#160; I shall give directions
that you may remain behind when the others go, so that
you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being
overlooked.&#160; When you have <i>finished</i>, <i>relock</i>
<i>both</i> the original and the draft in the desk, and
hand them over to me personally to-morrow morning.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I took the papers and&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Excuse me an instant,&#8221;
said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;W&#232;r&#233; you alone during this
conversation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a large room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty feet each way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the centre?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And speaking low?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My uncle&#8217;s voice is always remarkably
low.&#160; I hardly spoke at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Holmes, shutting his
eyes; &#8220;pray go on.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I did exactly what he indicated,
and waited until the other clerks had departed.&#160;
One of them in my room, Charles Gorot, had some arrears
of work to make up, so I left him there and went out
to dine.&#160; When I returned he was gone.&#160; I
was anxious to hurry my work, for I knew that Joseph&#8212;&#173;the
Mr. Harrison whom you saw just now&#8212;&#173;was in
town, and that he would travel down to Woking by the
eleven-o&#8217;clock train, and I wanted if possible
to catch it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;When I came to examine the
treaty I saw at once that it was of such importance
that my uncle had been guilty of no exaggeration in
what he had said.&#160; Without going into details,
I may say that it defined the position of Great Britain
towards the Triple Alliance, and fore-shadowed the
policy which this country would pursue in the event
of the French fleet gaining a complete ascendancy
over that of Italy in the Mediterranean.&#160; The
questions treated in it were purely naval.&#160; At
the end were the signatures of the high dignitaries
who had signed it.&#160; I glanced my eyes over it,
and then settled down to my task of copying.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was a long document, written
in the French language, and containing twenty-six
separate articles.&#160; I copied as quickly as I could,
but at nine o&#8217;clock I had only done nine articles,
and it seemed hopeless for me to attempt to catch
my train.&#160; I was feeling drowsy and stupid, partly
from my dinner and also from the effects of a long
day&#8217;s work.&#160; A cup of coffee would clear
my brain.&#160; A <i>commissionnaire</i> remains all night
in a little lodge at the foot of the stairs, and is
in the habit of making coffee at his spirit-lamp for
any of the officials who may be working over time.&#160;
I rang the bell, therefore, to summon him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;To my surprise, it was a woman
who answered the summons, a large, coarse-faced, elderly
woman, in an apron.&#160; She explained that she was
the commissionnaire&#8217;s wife, who did the charing,
and I gave her the order for the coffee.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I wrote two more articles and
then, feeling more drowsy than ever, I rose and walked
up and down the room to stretch my legs.&#160; My coffee
had not yet come, and I wondered what was the cause
of the delay could be.&#160; Opening the door, I started
down the corridor to find out.&#160; There was a straight
passage, dimly lighted, which led from the room in
which I had been working, and was the only exit from
it.&#160; It ended in a curving staircase, with the
commissionnaire&#8217;s lodge in the passage at the
bottom.&#160; Half way down this staircase is a small
landing, with another passage running into it at right
angles.&#160; This second one leads by means of a second
small stair to a side door, used by servants, and also
as a short cut by clerks when coming from Charles
Street.&#160; Here is a rough chart of the place.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Thank you.&#160; I think that
I quite follow you,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is of the utmost importance
that you should notice this point.&#160; I went down
the stairs and into the hall, where I found the <i>commissionnaire</i>
<i>fast</i> asleep in his box, with the kettle boiling
furiously upon the spirit-lamp.&#160; I took off the
kettle and blew out the lamp, for the water was spurting
over the floor.&#160; Then I put out my hand and was
about to shake the man, who was still sleeping soundly,
when a bell over his head rang loudly, and he woke
with a start.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Phelps, sir!&#8217;
said he, looking at me in bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I came down to see if my coffee was
ready.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I was boiling the kettle
when I fell asleep, sir.&#8217;&#160; He looked at me
and then up at the still quivering bell with an ever-growing
astonishment upon his face.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;If you was here, sir,
then who rang the bell?&#8217; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The bell!&#8217; I cried.&#160; &#8216;What
bell is it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s the bell of the room you
were working in.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;A cold hand seemed to close
round my heart.&#160; Some one, then, was in that room
where my precious treaty lay upon the table.&#160; I
ran frantically up the stair and along the passage.&#160;
There was no one in the corridors, Mr. Holmes.&#160;
There was no one in the room.&#160; All was exactly
as I left it, save only that the papers which had
been committed to my care had been taken from the
desk on which they lay.&#160; The copy was there, and
the original was gone.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes sat up in his chair and rubbed
his hands.&#160; I could see that the problem was entirely
to his heart.&#160; &#8220;Pray, what did you do then?&#8221;
he murmured.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I recognized in an instant
that the thief must have come up the stairs from the
side door.&#160; Of course I must have met him if he
had come the other way.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You were satisfied that he
could not have been concealed in the room all the
time, or in the corridor which you have just described
as dimly lighted?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is absolutely impossible.&#160;
A rat could not conceal himself either in the room
or the corridor.&#160; There is no cover at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#160; Pray proceed.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The <i>commissionnaire</i>, seeing
by my pale face that something was to be feared, had
followed me upstairs.&#160; Now we both rushed along
the corridor and down the steep steps which led to
Charles Street.&#160; The door at the bottom was closed,
but unlocked.&#160; We flung it open and rushed out.&#160;
I can distinctly remember that as we did so there
came three chimes from a neighboring clock.&#160; It
was quarter to ten.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is of enormous importance,&#8221;
said Holmes, making a note upon his shirt-cuff.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The night was very dark, and
a thin, warm rain was falling.&#160; There was no one
in Charles Street, but a great traffic was going on,
as usual, in Whitehall, at the extremity.&#160; We
rushed along the pavement, bare-headed as we were,
and at the far corner we found a policeman standing.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;A robbery has been committed,&#8217;
I gasped.&#160; &#8217;A document of immense value
has been stolen from the Foreign Office.&#160; Has any
one passed this way?&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I have been standing
here for a quarter of an hour, sir,&#8217; said he;
&#8217;only one person has passed during that time&#8212;&#173;a
woman, tall and elderly, with a Paisley shawl.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Ah, that is only my
wife,&#8217; cried the <i>commissionnaire</i>; &#8217;has
no one else passed?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No one.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Then it must be the
other way that the thief took,&#8217; cried the fellow,
tugging at my sleeve.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;But I was not satisfied,
and the attempts which he made to draw me away increased
my suspicions.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Which way did the woman go?&#8217; I
cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;I don&#8217;t know,
sir.&#160; I noticed her pass, but I had no special
reason for watching her.&#160; She seemed to be in
a hurry.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How long ago was it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, not very many minutes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Within the last five?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, it could not be more than five.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8217;You&#8217;re only wasting
your time, sir, and every minute now is of importance,&#8217;
cried the <i>commissionnaire</i>; &#8217;<i>take</i> my
word for it that my old woman has nothing to do with
it, and come down to the other end of the street.&#160;
Well, if you won&#8217;t, I will.&#8217;&#160; And with
that he rushed off in the other direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I was after him in an instant and caught
him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where do you live?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;16 Ivy Lane, Brixton,&#8217;
he answered.&#160; &#8217;But don&#8217;t let yourself
be drawn away upon a false scent, Mr. Phelps.&#160;
Come to the other end of the street and let us see
if we can hear of anything.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Nothing was to be lost by following
his advice.&#160; With the policeman we both hurried
down, but only to find the street full of traffic,
many people coming and going, but all only too eager
to get to a place of safety upon so wet a night.&#160;
There was no lounger who could tell us who had passed.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then we returned to the office,
and searched the stairs and the passage without result.&#160;
The corridor which led to the room was laid down with
a kind of creamy linoleum which shows an impression
very easily.&#160; We examined it very carefully, but
found no outline of any footmark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had it been raining all evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since about seven.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;How is it, then, that the woman
who came into the room about nine left no traces with
her muddy boots?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am glad you raised the point.&#160;
It occurred to me at the time.&#160; The charwomen
are in the habit of taking off their boots at the
commissionnaire&#8217;s office, and putting on list
slippers.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is very clear.&#160; There
were no marks, then, though the night was a wet one?&#160;
The chain of events is certainly one of extraordinary
interest.&#160; What did you do next?</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We examined the room also.&#160;
There is no possibility of a secret door, and the
windows are quite thirty feet from the ground.&#160;
Both of them were fastened on the inside.&#160; The
carpet prevents any possibility of a trap-door, and
the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind.&#160;
I will pledge my life that whoever stole my papers
could only have come through the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the fireplace?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They use none.&#160; There is
a stove.&#160; The bell-rope hangs from the wire just
to the right of my desk.&#160; Whoever rang it must
have come right up to the desk to do it.&#160; But
why should any criminal wish to ring the bell?&#160;
It is a most insoluble mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Certainly the incident was
unusual.&#160; What were your next steps?&#160; You
examined the room, I presume, to see if the intruder
had left any traces&#8212;&#173;any cigar-end or dropped
glove or hairpin or other trifle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was nothing of the sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No smell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we never thought of that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, a scent of tobacco would
have been worth a great deal to us in such an investigation.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I never smoke myself, so I
think I should have observed it if there had been
any smell of tobacco.&#160; There was absolutely no
clue of any kind.&#160; The only tangible fact was
that the commissionnaire&#8217;s wife&#8212;&#173;Mrs.
Tangey was the name&#8212;&#173;had hurried out of
the place.&#160; He could give no explanation save
that it was about the time when the woman always went
home.&#160; The policeman and I agreed that our best
plan would be to seize the woman before she could
get rid of the papers, presuming that she had them.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The alarm had reached Scotland
Yard by this time, and Mr. Forbes, the detective,
came round at once and took up the case with a great
deal of energy.&#160; We hired a hansom, and in half
an hour we were at the address which had been given
to us.&#160; A young woman opened the door, who proved
to be Mrs. Tangey&#8217;s eldest daughter.&#160; Her
mother had not come back yet, and we were shown into
the front room to wait.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;About ten minutes later a knock
came at the door, and here we made the one serious
mistake for which I blame myself.&#160; Instead of opening
the door ourselves, we allowed the girl to do so.&#160;
We heard her say, &#8217;Mother, there are two men
in the house waiting to see you,&#8217; and an instant
afterwards we heard the patter of feet rushing down
the passage.&#160; Forbes flung open the door, and
we both ran into the back room or kitchen, but the
woman had got there before us.&#160; She stared at us
with defiant eyes, and then, suddenly recognizing
me, an expression of absolute astonishment came over
her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, if it isn&#8217;t Mr. Phelps, of
the office!&#8217; she cried.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Come, come, who did
you think we were when you ran away from us?&#8217;
asked my companion.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I thought you were the
brokers,&#8217; said she, &#8217;we have had some trouble
with a tradesman.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s not quite
good enough,&#8217; answered Forbes.&#160; &#8217;We
have reason to believe that you have taken a paper
of importance from the Foreign Office, and that you
ran in here to dispose of it.&#160; You must come back
with us to Scotland Yard to be searched.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was in vain that she protested
and resisted.&#160; A four-wheeler was brought, and
we all three drove back in it.&#160; We had first made
an examination of the kitchen, and especially of the
kitchen fire, to see whether she might have made away
with the papers during the instant that she was alone.&#160;
There were no signs, however, of any ashes or scraps.&#160;
When we reached Scotland Yard she was handed over at
once to the female searcher.&#160; I waited in an agony
of suspense until she came back with her report.&#160;
There were no signs of the papers.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then for the first time the
horror of my situation came in its full force.&#160;
Hitherto I had been acting, and action had numbed thought.&#160;
I had been so confident of regaining the treaty at
once that I had not dared to think of what would be
the consequence if I failed to do so.&#160; But now
there was nothing more to be done, and I had leisure
to realize my position.&#160; It was horrible.&#160;
Watson there would tell you that I was a nervous,
sensitive boy at school.&#160; It is my nature.&#160;
I thought of my uncle and of his colleagues in the
Cabinet, of the shame which I had brought upon him,
upon myself, upon every one connected with me.&#160;
What though I was the victim of an extraordinary accident?&#160;
No allowance is made for accidents where diplomatic
interests are at stake.&#160; I was ruined, shamefully,
hopelessly ruined.&#160; I don&#8217;t know what I did.&#160;
I fancy I must have made a scene.&#160; I have a dim
recollection of a group of officials who crowded round
me, endeavoring to soothe me.&#160; One of them drove
down with me to Waterloo, and saw me into the Woking
train.&#160; I believe that he would have come all
the way had it not been that Dr. Ferrier, who lives
near me, was going down by that very train.&#160; The
doctor most kindly took charge of me, and it was well
he did so, for I had a fit in the station, and before
we reached home I was practically a raving maniac.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You can imagine the state of
things here when they were roused from their beds
by the doctor&#8217;s ringing and found me in this
condition.&#160; Poor Annie here and my mother were
broken-hearted.&#160; Dr. Ferrier had just heard enough
from the detective at the station to be able to give
an idea of what had happened, and his story did not
mend matters.&#160; It was evident to all that I was
in for a long illness, so Joseph was bundled out of
this cheery bedroom, and it was turned into a sick-room
for me.&#160; Here I have lain, Mr. Holmes, for over
nine weeks, unconscious, and raving with brain-fever.&#160;
If it had not been for Miss Harrison here and for the
doctor&#8217;s care I should not be speaking to you
now.&#160; She has nursed me by day and a hired nurse
has looked after me by night, for in my mad fits I
was capable of anything.&#160; Slowly my reason has
cleared, but it is only during the last three days
that my memory has quite returned.&#160; Sometimes
I wish that it never had.&#160; The first thing that
I did was to wire to Mr. Forbes, who had the case
in hand.&#160; He came out, and assures me that, though
everything has been done, no trace of a clue has been
discovered.&#160; The <i>commissionnaire</i> and his
wife have been examined in every way without any light
being thrown upon the matter.&#160; The suspicions of
the police then rested upon young Gorot, who, as you
may remember, stayed over time in the office that
night.&#160; His remaining behind and his French name
were really the only two points which could suggest
suspicion; but, as a matter of fact, I did not begin
work until he had gone, and his people are of Huguenot
extraction, but as English in sympathy and tradition
as you and I are.&#160; Nothing was found to implicate
him in any way, and there the matter dropped.&#160;
I turn to you, Mr. Holmes, as absolutely my last hope.&#160;
If you fail me, then my honor as well as my position
are forever forfeited.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The invalid sank back upon his cushions,
tired out by this long recital, while his nurse poured
him out a glass of some stimulating medicine.&#160;
Holmes sat silently, with his head thrown back and
his eyes closed, in an attitude which might seem listless
to a stranger, but which I knew betokened the most
intense self-absorption.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You statement has been so explicit,&#8221;
said he at last, &#8220;that you have really left
me very few questions to ask.&#160; There is one of
the very utmost importance, however.&#160; Did you
tell any one that you had this special task to perform?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Miss Harrison here, for example?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No.&#160; I had not been back
to Woking between getting the order and executing
the commission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And none of your people had by chance been
to see you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did any of them know their way about in the
office?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, all of them had been shown over it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Still, of course, if you said
nothing to any one about the treaty these inquiries
are irrelevant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know anything of the <i>commissionnaire</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing except that he is an old soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What regiment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I have heard&#8212;&#173;Coldstream Guards.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Thank you.&#160; I have no doubt
I can get details from Forbes.&#160; The authorities
are excellent at amassing facts, though they do not
always use them to advantage.&#160; What a lovely thing
a rose is!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He walked past the couch to the open
window, and held up the drooping stalk of a moss-rose,
looking down at the dainty blend of crimson and green.&#160;
It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had
never before seen him show any keen interest in natural
objects.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There is nothing in which deduction
is so necessary as in religion,&#8221; said he, leaning
with his back against the shutters.&#160; &#8220;It
can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner.&#160;
Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence
seems to me to rest in the flowers.&#160; All other
things, our powers our desires, our food, are all really
necessary for our existence in the first instance.&#160;
But this rose is an extra.&#160; Its smell and its
color are an embellishment of life, not a condition
of it.&#160; It is only goodness which gives extras,
and so I say again that we have much to hope from
the flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Percy Phelps and his nurse looked
at Holmes during this demonstration with surprise
and a good deal of disappointment written upon their
faces.&#160; He had fallen into a reverie, with the
moss-rose between his fingers.&#160; It had lasted
some minutes before the young lady broke in upon it.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Do you see any prospect of
solving this mystery, Mr. Holmes?&#8221; she asked,
with a touch of asperity in her voice.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, the mystery!&#8221; he
answered, coming back with a start to the realities
of life.&#160; &#8220;Well, it would be absurd to deny
that the case is a very abstruse and complicated one,
but I can promise you that I will look into the matter
and let you know any points which may strike me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see any clue?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You have furnished me with
seven, but, of course, I must test them before I can
pronounce upon their value.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You suspect some one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suspect myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of coming to conclusions too rapidly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go to London and test your conclusions.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your advice is very excellent,
Miss Harrison,&#8221; said Holmes, rising.&#160; &#8220;I
think, Watson, we cannot do better.&#160; Do not allow
yourself to indulge in false hopes, Mr. Phelps.&#160;
The affair is a very tangled one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be in a fever until I see you again,&#8221;
cried the diplomatist.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll come out by
the same train to-morrow, though it&#8217;s more than
likely that my report will be a negative one.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;God bless you for promising
to come,&#8221; cried our client.&#160; &#8220;It gives
me fresh life to know that something is being done.&#160;
By the way, I have had a letter from Lord Holdhurst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#160; What did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He was cold, but not harsh.&#160;
I dare say my severe illness prevented him from being
that.&#160; He repeated that the matter was of the utmost
importance, and added that no steps would be taken
about my future&#8212;&#173;by which he means, of course,
my dismissal&#8212;&#173;until my health was restored
and I had an opportunity of repairing my misfortune.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, that was reasonable and
considerate,&#8221; said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;Come,
Watson, for we have a good day&#8217;s work before
us in town.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Mr. Joseph Harrison drove us down
to the station, and we were soon whirling up in a
Portsmouth train.&#160; Holmes was sunk in profound
thought, and hardly opened his mouth until we had
passed Clapham Junction.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It&#8217;s a very cheery thing
to come into London by any of these lines which run
high, and allow you to look down upon the houses like
this.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I thought he was joking, for the view
was sordid enough, but he soon explained himself.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Look at those big, isolated
clumps of building rising up above the slates, like
brick islands in a lead-colored sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The board-schools.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Light-houses, my boy!&#160;
Beacons of the future!&#160; Capsules with hundreds
of bright little seeds in each, out of which will
spring the wise, better England of the future.&#160;
I suppose that man Phelps does not drink?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not think so.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Nor should I, but we are bound
to take every possibility into account.&#160; The poor
devil has certainly got himself into very deep water,
and it&#8217;s a question whether we shall ever be
able to get him ashore.&#160; What did you think of
Miss Harrison?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl of strong character.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, but she is a good sort,
or I am mistaken.&#160; She and her brother are the
only children of an iron-master somewhere up Northumberland
way.&#160; He got engaged to her when traveling last
winter, and she came down to be introduced to his
people, with her brother as escort.&#160; Then came
the smash, and she stayed on to nurse her lover, while
brother Joseph, finding himself pretty snug, stayed
on too.&#160; I&#8217;ve been making a few independent
inquiries, you see.&#160; But to-day must be a day of
inquiries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My practice&#8212;&#173;&#8221; I began.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, if you find your own cases
more interesting than mine&#8212;&#173;&#8221; said
Holmes, with some asperity.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I was going to say that my
practice could get along very well for a day or two,
since it is the slackest time in the year.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; said he,
recovering his good-humor.&#160; &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll
look into this matter together.&#160; I think that
we should begin by seeing Forbes.&#160; He can probably
tell us all the details we want until we know from
what side the case is to be approached.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you had a clue?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, we have several, but
we can only test their value by further inquiry.&#160;
The most difficult crime to track is the one which
is purposeless.&#160; Now this is not purposeless.&#160;
Who is it who profits by it?&#160; There is the French
ambassador, there is the Russian, there is whoever
might sell it to either of these, and there is Lord
Holdhurst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Holdhurst!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, it is just conceivable
that a statesman might find himself in a position
where he was not sorry to have such a document accidentally
destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Not a statesman with the honorable
record of Lord Holdhurst?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is a possibility and we
cannot afford to disregard it.&#160; We shall see the
noble lord to-day and find out if he can tell us anything.&#160;
Meanwhile I have already set inquiries on foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Already?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, I sent wires from Woking
station to every evening paper in London.&#160; This
advertisement will appear in each of them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">He handed over a sheet torn from a
note-book.&#160; On it was scribbled in pencil:&#160;
&#8220;L10 reward.&#160; The number of the cab which
dropped a fare at or about the door of the Foreign
Office in Charles Street at quarter to ten in the
evening of May 23d.&#160; Apply 221 B, Baker Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are confident that the thief came in a
cab?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If not, there is no harm done.&#160;
But if Mr. Phelps is correct in stating that there
is no hiding-place either in the room or the corridors,
then the person must have come from outside.&#160;
If he came from outside on so wet a night, and yet
left no trace of damp upon the linoleum, which was
examined within a few minutes of his passing, then
it is exceeding probable that he came in a cab.&#160;
Yes, I think that we may safely deduce a cab.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds plausible.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is one of the clues of
which I spoke.&#160; It may lead us to something.&#160;
And then, of course, there is the bell&#8212;&#173;which
is the most distinctive feature of the case.&#160;
Why should the bell ring?&#160; Was it the thief who
did it out of bravado?&#160; Or was it some one who
was with the thief who did it in order to prevent
the crime?&#160; Or was it an accident?&#160; Or was
it&#8212;?&#8221; He sank back into the state of
intense and silent thought from which he had emerged;
but it seemed to me, accustomed as I was to his every
mood, that some new possibility had dawned suddenly
upon him.</p>

<p align="justify">It was twenty past three when we reached
our terminus, and after a hasty luncheon at the buffet
we pushed on at once to Scotland Yard.&#160; Holmes
had already wired to Forbes, and we found him waiting
to receive us&#8212;&#173;a small, foxy man with a
sharp but by no means amiable expression.&#160; He
was decidedly frigid in his manner to us, especially
when he heard the errand upon which we had come.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of your methods
before now, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he, tartly.&#160;
&#8220;You are ready enough to use all the information
that the police can lay at your disposal, and then
you try to finish the case yourself and bring discredit
on them.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; said
Holmes, &#8220;out of my last fifty-three cases my
name has only appeared in four, and the police have
had all the credit in forty-nine.&#160; I don&#8217;t
blame you for not knowing this, for you are young
and inexperienced, but if you wish to get on in your
new duties you will work with me and not against me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I&#8217;d be very glad of a
hint or two,&#8221; said the detective, changing his
manner.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ve certainly had no credit
from the case so far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What steps have you taken?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Tangey, the <i>commissionnaire</i>,
has been shadowed.&#160; He left the Guards with a
good character and we can find nothing against him.&#160;
His wife is a bad lot, though.&#160; I fancy she knows
more about this than appears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you shadowed her?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We have set one of our women
on to her.&#160; Mrs. Tangey drinks, and our woman
has been with her twice when she was well on, but she
could get nothing out of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand that they have had brokers in
the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but they were paid off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did the money come from?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That was all right.&#160; His
pension was due.&#160; They have not shown any sign
of being in funds.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;What explanation did she give
of having answered the bell when Mr. Phelps rang for
the coffee?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She said that he husband was
very tired and she wished to relieve him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, certainly that would
agree with his being found a little later asleep in
his chair.&#160; There is nothing against them then
but the woman&#8217;s character.&#160; Did you ask
her why she hurried away that night?&#160; Her haste
attracted the attention of the police constable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was later than usual and wanted to get
home.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Did you point out to her that
you and Mr. Phelps, who started at least twenty minutes
after her, got home before her?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She explains that by the difference
between a &#8217;bus and a hansom.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Did she make it clear why,
on reaching her house, she ran into the back kitchen?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because she had the money there
with which to pay off the brokers.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;She has at least an answer
for everything.&#160; Did you ask her whether in leaving
she met any one or saw any one loitering about Charles
Street?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She saw no one but the constable.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, you seem to have cross-examined
her pretty thoroughly.&#160; What else have you done?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The clerk Gorot has been shadowed
all these nine weeks, but without result.&#160; We
can show nothing against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we have nothing else to go upon&#8212;&#173;no
evidence of any kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you formed a theory about how that bell
rang?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, I must confess that it
beats me.&#160; It was a cool hand, whoever it was,
to go and give the alarm like that.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, it was queer thing to
do.&#160; Many thanks to you for what you have told
me.&#160; If I can put the man into your hands you shall
hear from me.&#160; Come along, Watson.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Where are we going to now?&#8221;
I asked, as we left the office.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We are now going to interview
Lord Holdhurst, the cabinet minister and future premier
of England.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We were fortunate in finding that
Lord Holdhurst was still in his chambers in Downing
Street, and on Holmes sending in his card we were
instantly shown up.&#160; The statesman received us
with that old-fashioned courtesy for which he is remarkable,
and seated us on the two luxuriant lounges on either
side of the fireplace.&#160; Standing on the rug between
us, with his slight, tall figure, his sharp features,
thoughtful face, and curling hair prematurely tinged
with gray, he seemed to represent that not too common
type, a nobleman who is in truth noble.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Your name is very familiar
to me, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he, smiling.&#160; &#8220;And,
of course, I cannot pretend to be ignorant of the object
of your visit.&#160; There has only been one occurrence
in these offices which could call for your attention.&#160;
In whose interest are you acting, may I ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that of Mr. Percy Phelps,&#8221; answered
Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, my unfortunate nephew!&#160;
You can understand that our kinship makes it the more
impossible for me to screen him in any way.&#160; I
fear that the incident must have a very prejudicial
effect upon his career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if the document is found?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that, of course, would be different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had one or two questions which I wished to
ask you, Lord Holdhurst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be happy to give you any information
in my power.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Was it in this room that you
gave your instructions as to the copying of the document?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you could hardly have been overheard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is out of the question.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Did you ever mention to any
one that it was your intention to give any one the
treaty to be copied?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are certain of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, since you never said
so, and Mr. Phelps never said so, and nobody else
knew anything of the matter, then the thief&#8217;s
presence in the room was purely accidental.&#160; He
saw his chance and he took it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The statesman smiled.&#160; &#8220;You take me out
of my province there,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes considered for a moment.&#160;
&#8220;There is another very important point which
I wish to discuss with you,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;You
feared, as I understand, that very grave results might
follow from the details of this treaty becoming known.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A shadow passed over the expressive
face of the statesman.&#160; &#8220;V&#233;ry grave results
indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any have they occurred?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If the treaty had reached,
let us say, the French or Russian Foreign Office,
you would expect to hear of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should,&#8221; said Lord Holdhurst, with
a wry face.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Since nearly ten weeks have
elapsed, then, and nothing has been heard, it is not
unfair to suppose that for some reason the treaty has
not reached them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Holdhurst shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We can hardly suppose, Mr.
Holmes, that the thief took the treaty in order to
frame it and hang it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he is waiting for a better price.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;If he waits a little longer
he will get no price at all.&#160; The treaty will
cease to be secret in a few months.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That is most important,&#8221;
said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;Of course, it is a possible
supposition that the thief has had a sudden illness&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;An attack of brain-fever, for
example?&#8221; asked the statesman, flashing a swift
glance at him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I did not say so,&#8221; said
Holmes, imperturbably.&#160; &#8220;And now, Lord Holdhurst,
we have already taken up too much of your valuable
time, and we shall wish you good-day.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Every success to your investigation,
be the criminal who it may,&#8221; answered the nobleman,
as he bowed us out the door.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He&#8217;s a fine fellow,&#8221;
said Holmes, as we came out into Whitehall.&#160; &#8220;But
he has a struggle to keep up his position.&#160; He
is far from rich and has many calls.&#160; You noticed,
of course, that his boots had been <i>res&#248;led</i>.&#160;
Now, Watson, I won&#8217;t detain you from your legitimate
work any longer.&#160; I shall do nothing more to-day,
unless I have an answer to my cab advertisement.&#160;
But I should be extremely obliged to you if you would
come down with me to Woking to-morrow, by the same
train which we took yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I met him accordingly next morning
and we traveled down to Woking together.&#160; He had
had no answer to his advertisement, he said, and no
fresh light had been thrown upon the case.&#160; He
had, when he so willed it, the utter immobility of
countenance of a red Indian, and I could not gather
from his appearance whether he was satisfied or not
with the position of the case.&#160; His conversation,
I remember, was about the Bertillon system of measurements,
and he expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the
French savant.</p>

<p align="justify">We found our client still under the
charge of his devoted nurse, but looking considerably
better than before.&#160; He rose from the sofa and
greeted us without difficulty when we entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any news?&#8221; he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My report, as I expected, is
a negative one,&#8221; said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;I have
seen Forbes, and I have seen your uncle, and I have
set one or two trains of inquiry upon foot which may
lead to something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not lost heart, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;God bless you for saying that!&#8221;
cried Miss Harrison.&#160; &#8220;If we keep our courage
and our patience the truth must come out.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We have more to tell you than
you have for us,&#8221; said Phelps, reseating himself
upon the couch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped you might have something.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, we have had an adventure
during the night, and one which might have proved
to be a serious one.&#8221;&#160; His expression grew
very grave as he spoke, and a look of something akin
to fear sprang up in his eyes.&#160; &#8220;Do you
know,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I begin to believe
that I am the unconscious centre of some monstrous
conspiracy, and that my life is aimed at as well as
my honor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It sounds incredible, for I
have not, as far as I know, an enemy in the world.&#160;
Yet from last night&#8217;s experience I can come to
no other conclusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray let me hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You must know that last night
was the very first night that I have ever slept without
a nurse in the room.&#160; I was so much better that
I thought I could dispense with one.&#160; I had a
night-light burning, however.&#160; Well, about two
in the morning I had sunk into a light sleep when I
was suddenly aroused by a slight noise.&#160; It was
like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing
a plank, and I lay listening to it for some time under
the impression that it must come from that cause.&#160;
Then it grew louder, and suddenly there came from
the window a sharp metallic snick.&#160; I sat up in
amazement.&#160; There could be no doubt what the sounds
were now.&#160; The first ones had been caused by some
one forcing an instrument through the slit between
the sashes, and the second by the catch being pressed
back.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There was a pause then for
about ten minutes, as if the person were waiting to
see whether the noise had awakened me.&#160; Then I
heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly
opened.&#160; I could stand it no longer, for my nerves
are not what they used to be.&#160; I sprang out of
bed and flung open the shutters.&#160; A man was crouching
at the window.&#160; I could see little of him, for
he was gone like a flash.&#160; He was wrapped in some
sort of cloak which came across the lower part of his
face.&#160; One thing only I am sure of, and that is
that he had some weapon in his hand.&#160; It looked
to me like a long knife.&#160; I distinctly saw the
gleam of it as he turned to run.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;This is most interesting,&#8221;
said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;Pray what did you do then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I should have followed him
through the open window if I had been stronger.&#160;
As it was, I rang the bell and roused the house.&#160;
It took me some little time, for the bell rings in
the kitchen and the servants all sleep upstairs.&#160;
I shouted, however, and that brought Joseph down, and
he roused the others.&#160; Joseph and the groom found
marks on the bed outside the window, but the weather
has been so dry lately that they found it hopeless
to follow the trail across the grass.&#160; There&#8217;s
a place, however, on the wooden fence which skirts
the road which shows signs, they tell me, as if some
one had got over, and had snapped the top of the rail
in doing so.&#160; I have said nothing to the local
police yet, for I thought I had best have your opinion
first.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">This tale of our client&#8217;s appeared
to have an extraordinary effect upon Sherlock Holmes.&#160;
He rose from his chair and paced about the room in
uncontrollable excitement.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Misfortunes never come single,&#8221;
said Phelps, smiling, though it was evident that his
adventure had somewhat shaken him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You have certainly had your
share,&#8221; said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;Do you think
you could walk round the house with me?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, yes, I should like a little
sunshine.&#160; Joseph will come, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I also,&#8221; said Miss Harrison.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I am afraid not,&#8221; said
Holmes, shaking his head.&#160; &#8220;I think I must
ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The young lady resumed her seat with
an air of displeasure.&#160; Her brother, however,
had joined us and we set off all four together.&#160;
We passed round the lawn to the outside of the young
diplomatist&#8217;s window.&#160; There were, as he
had said, marks upon the bed, but they were hopelessly
blurred and vague.&#160; Holmes stopped over them for
an instant, and then rose shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any one
could make much of this,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;Let
us go round the house and see why this particular
room was chosen by the burglar.&#160; I should have
thought those larger windows of the drawing-room and
dining-room would have had more attractions for him.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They are more visible from
the road,&#8221; suggested Mr. Joseph Harrison.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Ah, yes, of course.&#160; There
is a door here which he might have attempted.&#160;
What is it for?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is the side entrance for
trades-people.&#160; Of course it is locked at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever had an alarm like this before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; said our client.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you keep plate in the house, or anything
to attract burglars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing of value.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Holmes strolled round the house with
his hands in his pockets and a negligent air which
was unusual with him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said he
to Joseph Harrison, &#8220;you found some place, I
understand, where the fellow scaled the fence.&#160;
Let us have a look at that!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The plump young man led us to a spot
where the top of one of the wooden rails had been
cracked.&#160; A small fragment of the wood was hanging
down.&#160; Holmes pulled it off and examined it critically.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Do you think that was done
last night?&#160; It looks rather old, does it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, possibly so.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There are no marks of any one
jumping down upon the other side.&#160; No, I fancy
we shall get no help here.&#160; Let us go back to the
bedroom and talk the matter over.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Percy Phelps was walking very slowly,
leaning upon the arm of his future brother-in-law.&#160;
Holmes walked swiftly across the lawn, and we were
at the open window of the bedroom long before the
others came up.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Miss Harrison,&#8221; said
Holmes, speaking with the utmost intensity of manner,
&#8220;you must stay where you are all day.&#160; Let
nothing prevent you from staying where you are all
day.&#160; It is of the utmost importance.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Certainly, if you wish it,
Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said the girl in astonishment.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;When you go to bed lock the
door of this room on the outside and keep the key.&#160;
Promise to do this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Percy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will come to London with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And am I to remain here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for his sake.&#160; You can serve him.&#160;
Quick!&#160; Promise!&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a quick nod of assent just as the other two
came up.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Why do you sit moping there,
Annie?&#8221; cried her brother.&#160; &#8220;Come out
into the sunshine!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No, thank you, Joseph.&#160;
I have a slight headache and this room is deliciously
cool and soothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you propose now, Mr. Holmes?&#8221;
asked our client.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, in investigating this
minor affair we must not lose sight of our main inquiry.&#160;
It would be a very great help to me if you would come
up to London with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as soon as you conveniently can.&#160;
Say in an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel quite strong enough, if I can really
be of any help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The greatest possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would like me to stay there to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just going to propose it.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then, if my friend of the night
comes to revisit me, he will find the bird flown.&#160;
We are all in your hands, Mr. Holmes, and you must
tell us exactly what you would like done.&#160; Perhaps
you would prefer that Joseph came with us so as to
look after me?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, no; my friend Watson is
a medical man, you know, and he&#8217;ll look after
you.&#160; We&#8217;ll have our lunch here, if you will
permit us, and then we shall all three set off for
town together.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It was arranged as he suggested, though
Miss Harrison excused herself from leaving the bedroom,
in accordance with Holmes&#8217;s suggestion.&#160;
What the object of my friend&#8217;s manoeuvres was
I could not conceive, unless it were to keep the lady
away from Phelps, who, rejoiced by his returning health
and by the prospect of action, lunched with us in the
dining-room.&#160; Holmes had a still more startling
surprise for us, however, for, after accompanying
us down to the station and seeing us into our carriage,
he calmly announced that he had no intention of leaving
Woking.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There are one or two small
points which I should desire to clear up before I
go,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;Your absence, Mr. Phelps,
will in some ways rather assist me.&#160; Watson, when
you reach London you would oblige me by driving at
once to Baker Street with our friend here, and remaining
with him until I see you again.&#160; It is fortunate
that you are old school-fellows, as you must have
much to talk over.&#160; Mr. Phelps can have the spare
bedroom to-night, and I will be with you in time for
breakfast, for there is a train which will take me
into Waterloo at eight.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But how about our investigation
in London?&#8221; asked Phelps, ruefully.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;We can do that to-morrow.&#160;
I think that just at present I can be of more immediate
use here.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You might tell them at Briarbrae
that I hope to be back to-morrow night,&#8221; cried
Phelps, as we began to move from the platform.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I hardly expect to go back
to Briarbrae,&#8221; answered Holmes, and waved his
hand to us cheerily as we shot out from the station.</p>

<p align="justify">Phelps and I talked it over on our
journey, but neither of us could devise a satisfactory
reason for this new development.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I suppose he wants to find
out some clue as to the burglary last night, if a
burglar it was.&#160; For myself, I don&#8217;t believe
it was an ordinary thief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your own idea, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Upon my word, you may put it
down to my weak nerves or not, but I believe there
is some deep political intrigue going on around me,
and that for some reason that passes my understanding
my life is aimed at by the conspirators.&#160; It sounds
high-flown and absurd, but consider the facts!&#160;
Why should a thief try to break in at a bedroom window,
where there could be no hope of any plunder, and why
should he come with a long knife in his hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure it was not a house-breaker&#8217;s
jimmy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, it was a knife.&#160; I saw the flash
of the blade quite distinctly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why on earth should you be pursued with
such animosity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is the question.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, if Holmes takes the same
view, that would account for his action, would it
not?&#160; Presuming that your theory is correct, if
he can lay his hands upon the man who threatened you
last night he will have gone a long way towards finding
who took the naval treaty.&#160; It is absurd to suppose
that you have two enemies, one of whom robs you, while
the other threatens your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Holmes said that he was not going to Briarbrae.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have known him for some time,&#8221;
said I, &#8220;but I never knew him do anything yet
without a very good reason,&#8221; and with that our
conversation drifted off on to other topics.</p>

<p align="justify">But it was a weary day for me.&#160;
Phelps was still weak after his long illness, and
his misfortune made him querulous and nervous.&#160;
In vain I endeavored to interest him in Afghanistan,
in India, in social questions, in anything which might
take his mind out of the groove.&#160; He would always
come back to his lost treaty, wondering, guessing,
speculating, as to what Holmes was doing, what steps
Lord Holdhurst was taking, what news we should have
in the morning.&#160; As the evening wore on his excitement
became quite painful.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have implicit faith in Holmes?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen him do some remarkable things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he never brought light into anything quite
so dark as this?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh, yes; I have known him solve
questions which presented fewer clues than yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not where such large interests are at stake?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that.&#160;
To my certain knowledge he has acted on behalf of
three of the reigning houses of Europe in very vital
matters.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But you know him well, Watson.&#160;
He is such an inscrutable fellow that I never quite
know what to make of him.&#160; Do you think he is hopeful?&#160;
Do you think he expects to make a success of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has said nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a bad sign.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;On the contrary, I have noticed
that when he is off the trail he generally says so.&#160;
It is when he is on a scent and is not quite absolutely
sure yet that it is the right one that he is most taciturn.&#160;
Now, my dear fellow, we can&#8217;t help matters by
making ourselves nervous about them, so let me implore
you to go to bed and so be fresh for whatever may
await us to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I was able at last to persuade my
companion to take my advice, though I knew from his
excited manner that there was not much hope of sleep
for him.&#160; Indeed, his mood was infectious, for
I lay tossing half the night myself, brooding over
this strange problem, and inventing a hundred theories,
each of which was more impossible than the last.&#160;
Why had Holmes remained at Woking?&#160; Why had he
asked Miss Harrison to remain in the sick-room all
day?&#160; Why had he been so careful not to inform
the people at Briarbrae that he intended to remain
near them?&#160; I cudgelled my brains until I fell
asleep in the endeavor to find some explanation which
would cover all these facts.</p>

<p align="justify">It was seven o&#8217;clock when I
awoke, and I set off at once for Phelps&#8217;s room,
to find him haggard and spent after a sleepless night.&#160;
His first question was whether Holmes had arrived
yet.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He&#8217;ll be here when he
promised,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and not an instant
sooner or later.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">And my words were true, for shortly
after eight a hansom dashed up to the door and our
friend got out of it.&#160; Standing in the window we
saw that his left hand was swathed in a bandage and
that his face was very grim and pale.&#160; He entered
the house, but it was some little time before he came
upstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks like a beaten man,&#8221; cried Phelps.</p>

<p align="justify">I was forced to confess that he was
right.&#160; &#8220;After all,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the
clue of the matter lies probably here in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phelps gave a groan.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it is,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;but I had hoped for so much from his
return.&#160; But surely his hand was not tied up like
that yesterday.&#160; What can be the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You are not wounded, Holmes?&#8221;
I asked, as my friend entered the room.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Tut, it is only a scratch through
my own clumsiness,&#8221; he answered, nodding his
good-mornings to us.&#160; &#8220;This case of yours,
Mr. Phelps, is certainly one of the darkest which
I have ever investigated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared that you would find it beyond you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been a most remarkable experience.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That bandage tells of adventures,&#8221;
said I.&#160; &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell us what has
happened?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;After breakfast, my dear Watson.&#160;
Remember that I have breathed thirty miles of Surrey
air this morning.&#160; I suppose that there has been
no answer from my cabman advertisement?&#160; Well,
well, we cannot expect to score every time.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The table was all laid, and just as
I was about to ring Mrs. Hudson entered with the tea
and coffee.&#160; A few minutes later she brought in
three covers, and we all drew up to the table, Holmes
ravenous, I curious, and Phelps in the gloomiest state
of depression.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Mrs. Hudson has risen to the
occasion,&#8221; said Holmes, uncovering a dish of
curried chicken.&#160; &#8220;Her cuisine is a little
limited, but she has as good an idea of breakfast
as a Scotch-woman.&#160; What have you here, Watson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ham and eggs,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Good!&#160; What are you going
to take, Mr. Phelps&#8212;&#173;curried fowl or eggs,
or will you help yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#160; I can eat nothing,&#8221; said
Phelps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come!&#160; Try the dish before you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I would really rather not.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Holmes,
with a mischievous twinkle, &#8220;I suppose that
you have no objection to helping me?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Phelps raised the cover, and as he
did so he uttered a scream, and sat there staring
with a face as white as the plate upon which he looked.&#160;
Across the centre of it was lying a little cylinder
of blue-gray paper.&#160; He caught it up, devoured
it with his eyes, and then danced madly about the
room, pressing it to his bosom and shrieking out in
his delight.&#160; Then he fell back into an arm-chair
so limp and exhausted with his own emotions that we
had to pour brandy down his throat to keep him from
fainting.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There! there!&#8221; said Holmes,
soothing, patting him upon the shoulder.&#160; &#8220;It
was too bad to spring it on you like this, but Watson
here will tell you that I never can resist a touch
of the dramatic.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Phelps seized his hand and kissed
it.&#160; &#8220;God bless you!&#8221; he cried.&#160;
&#8220;You have saved my honor.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, my own was at stake,
you know,&#8221; said Holmes.&#160; &#8220;I assure
you it is just as hateful to me to fail in a case
as it can be to you to blunder over a commission.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Phelps thrust away the precious document
into the innermost pocket of his coat.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I have not the heart to interrupt
your breakfast any further, and yet I am dying to
know how you got it and where it was.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Sherlock Holmes swallowed a cup of
coffee, and turned his attention to the ham and eggs.&#160;
Then he rose, lit his pipe, and settled himself down
into his chair.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I
did first, and how I came to do it afterwards,&#8221;
said he.&#160; &#8220;After leaving you at the station
I went for a charming walk through some admirable
Surrey scenery to a pretty little village called Ripley,
where I had my tea at an inn, and took the precaution
of filling my flask and of putting a paper of sandwiches
in my pocket.&#160; There I remained until evening,
when I set off for Woking again, and found myself
in the high-road outside Briarbrae just after sunset.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, I waited until the road
was clear&#8212;&#173;it is never a very frequented
one at any time, I fancy&#8212;&#173;and then I clambered
over the fence into the grounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely the gate was open!&#8221; ejaculated
Phelps.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, but I have a peculiar
taste in these matters.&#160; I chose the place where
the three fir-trees stand, and behind their screen
I got over without the least chance of any one in
the house being able to see me.&#160; I crouched down
among the bushes on the other side, and crawled from
one to the other&#8212;&#173;witness the disreputable
state of my trouser knees&#8212;&#173;until I had reached
the clump of rhododendrons just opposite to your bedroom
window.&#160; There I squatted down and awaited developments.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The blind was not down in your
room, and I could see Miss Harrison sitting there
reading by the table.&#160; It was quarter-past ten
when she closed her book, fastened the shutters, and
retired.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I heard her shut the door,
and felt quite sure that she had turned the key in
the lock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The key!&#8221; ejaculated Phelps.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes; I had given Miss Harrison
instructions to lock the door on the outside and take
the key with her when she went to bed.&#160; She carried
out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and
certainly without her cooperation you would not have
that paper in you coat-pocket.&#160; She departed then
and the lights went out, and I was left squatting in
the rhododendron-bush.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The night was fine, but still
it was a very weary vigil.&#160; Of course it has the
sort of excitement about it that the sportsman feels
when he lies beside the water-course and waits for
the big game.&#160; It was very long, though&#8212;&#173;almost
as long, Watson, as when you and I waited in that
deadly room when we looked into the little problem
of the Speckled Band.&#160; There was a church-clock
down at Woking which struck the quarters, and I thought
more than once that it had stopped.&#160; At last however
about two in the morning, I suddenly heard the gentle
sound of a bolt being pushed back and the creaking
of a key.&#160; A moment later the servants&#8217; door
was opened, and Mr. Joseph Harrison stepped out into
the moonlight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joseph!&#8221; ejaculated Phelps.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He was bare-headed, but he
had a black coat thrown over his shoulder so that
he could conceal his face in an instant if there were
any alarm.&#160; He walked on tiptoe under the shadow
of the wall, and when he reached the window he worked
a long-bladed knife through the sash and pushed back
the catch.&#160; Then he flung open the window, and
putting his knife through the crack in the shutters,
he thrust the bar up and swung them open.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;From where I lay I had a perfect
view of the inside of the room and of every one of
his movements.&#160; He lit the two candles which stood
upon the mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn
back the corner of the carpet in the neighborhood
of the door.&#160; Presently he stopped and picked out
a square piece of board, such as is usually left to
enable plumbers to get at the joints of the gas-pipes.&#160;
This one covered, as a matter of fact, the T joint
which gives off the pipe which supplies the kitchen
underneath.&#160; Out of this hiding-place he drew that
little cylinder of paper, pushed down the board, rearranged
the carpet, blew out the candles, and walked straight
into my arms as I stood waiting for him outside the
window.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, he has rather more viciousness
than I gave him credit for, has Master Joseph.&#160;
He flew at me with his knife, and I had to grasp him
twice, and got a cut over the knuckles, before I had
the upper hand of him.&#160; He looked murder out of
the only eye he could see with when we had finished,
but he listened to reason and gave up the papers.&#160;
Having got them I let my man go, but I wired full
particulars to Forbes this morning.&#160; If he is
quick enough to catch his bird, well and good.&#160;
But if, as I shrewdly suspect, he finds the nest empty
before he gets there, why, all the better for the
government.&#160; I fancy that Lord Holdhurst for one,
and Mr. Percy Phelps for another, would very much rather
that the affair never got as far as a police-court.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My God!&#8221; gasped our client.&#160;
&#8220;Do you tell me that during these long ten weeks
of agony the stolen papers were within the very room
with me all the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Joseph!&#160; Joseph a villain and a thief!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Hum!&#160; I am afraid Joseph&#8217;s
character is a rather deeper and more dangerous one
than one might judge from his appearance.&#160; From
what I have heard from him this morning, I gather
that he has lost heavily in dabbling with stocks,
and that he is ready to do anything on earth to better
his fortunes.&#160; Being an absolutely selfish man,
when a chance presented itself he did not allow either
his sister&#8217;s happiness or your reputation to
hold his hand.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">Percy Phelps sank back in his chair.&#160;
&#8220;My head whirls,&#8221; said he.&#160; &#8220;Your
words have dazed me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The principal difficulty in
your case,&#8221; remarked Holmes, in his didactic
fashion, &#8220;lay in the fact of there being too
much evidence.&#160; What was vital was overlaid and
hidden by what was irrelevant.&#160; Of all the facts
which were presented to us we had to pick just those
which we deemed to be essential, and then piece them
together in their order, so as to reconstruct this
very remarkable chain of events.&#160; I had already
begun to suspect Joseph, from the fact that you had
intended to travel home with him that night, and that
therefore it was a likely enough thing that he should
call for you, knowing the Foreign Office well, upon
his way.&#160; When I heard that some one had been so
anxious to get into the bedroom, in which no one but
Joseph could have concealed anything&#8212;&#173;you
told us in your narrative how you had turned Joseph
out when you arrived with the doctor&#8212;&#173;my
suspicions all changed to certainties, especially as
the attempt was made on the first night upon which
the nurse was absent, showing that the intruder was
well acquainted with the ways of the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How blind I have been!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The facts of the case, as far
as I have worked them out, are these:&#160; this Joseph
Harrison entered the office through the Charles Street
door, and knowing his way he walked straight into
your room the instant after you left it.&#160; Finding
no one there he promptly rang the bell, and at the
instant that he did so his eyes caught the paper upon
the table.&#160; A glance showed him that chance had
put in his way a State document of immense value,
and in an instant he had thrust it into his pocket
and was gone.&#160; A few minutes elapsed, as you remember,
before the sleepy <i>commissionnaire</i> drew your attention
to the bell, and those were just enough to give the
thief time to make his escape.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He made his way to Woking by
the first train, and having examined his booty and
assured himself that it really was of immense value,
he had concealed it in what he thought was a very
safe place, with the intention of taking it out again
in a day or two, and carrying it to the French embassy,
or wherever he thought that a long price was to be
had.&#160; Then came your sudden return.&#160; He, without
a moment&#8217;s warning, was bundled out of his room,
and from that time onward there were always at least
two of you there to prevent him from regaining his
treasure.&#160; The situation to him must have been
a maddening one.&#160; But at last he thought he saw
his chance.&#160; He tried to steal in, but was baffled
by your wakefulness.&#160; You remember that you did
not take your usual draught that night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I fancy that he had taken steps
to make that draught efficacious, and that he quite
relied upon your being unconscious.&#160; Of course,
I understood that he would repeat the attempt whenever
it could be done with safety.&#160; Your leaving the
room gave him the chance he wanted.&#160; I kept Miss
Harrison in it all day so that he might not anticipate
us.&#160; Then, having given him the idea that the
coast was clear, I kept guard as I have described.&#160;
I already knew that the papers were probably in the
room, but I had no desire to rip up all the planking
and skirting in search of them.&#160; I let him take
them, therefore, from the hiding-place, and so saved
myself an infinity of trouble.&#160; Is there any other
point which I can make clear?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Why did he try the window on
the first occasion,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;when he
might have entered by the door?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;In reaching the door he would
have to pass seven bedrooms.&#160; On the other hand,
he could get out on to the lawn with ease.&#160; Anything
else?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You do not think,&#8221; asked
Phelps, &#8220;that he had any murderous intention?&#160;
The knife was only meant as a tool.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It may be so,&#8221; answered
Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.&#160; &#8220;I can
only say for certain that Mr. Joseph Harrison is a
gentleman to whose mercy I should be extremely unwilling
to trust.&#8221;</p>

<mbp:pagebreak />
<h1>Adventure XI.&#160; The Final Problem</h1>

<p align="justify">It is with a heavy heart that I take
up my pen to write these the last words in which I
shall ever record the singular gifts by which my friend
Mr. Sherlock Holmes was distinguished.&#160; In an incoherent
and, as I deeply feel, an entirely inadequate fashion,
I have endeavored to give some account of my strange
experiences in his company from the chance which first
brought us together at the period of the &#8220;Study
in Scarlet,&#8221; up to the time of his interference
in the matter of the &#8220;Naval Treaty&#8221;&#8212;&#173;an
interference which had the unquestionable effect of
preventing a serious international complication.&#160;
It was my intention to have stopped there, and to
have said nothing of that event which has created a
void in my life which the lapse of two years has done
little to fill.&#160; My hand has been forced, however,
by the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty
defends the memory of his brother, and I have no choice
but to lay the facts before the public exactly as
they occurred.&#160; I alone know the absolute truth
of the matter, and I am satisfied that the time has
come when no good purpose is to be served by its suppression.&#160;
As far as I know, there have been only three accounts
in the public press:&#160; that in the Journal de Gen&#232;ve
on May 6th, 1891, the Reuter&#8217;s despatch in the
English papers on May 7th, and finally the recent letter
to which I have alluded.&#160; Of these the first and
second were extremely condensed, while the last is,
as I shall now show, an absolute perversion of the
facts.&#160; It lies with me to tell for the first
time what really took place between Professor Moriarty
and Mr. Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p align="justify">It may be remembered that after my
marriage, and my subsequent start in private practice,
the very intimate relations which had existed between
Holmes and myself became to some extent modified.&#160;
He still came to me from time to time when he desired
a companion in his investigation, but these occasions
grew more and more seldom, until I find that in the
year 1890 there were only three cases of which I retain
any record.&#160; During the winter of that year and
the early spring of 1891, I saw in the papers that
he had been engaged by the French government upon a
matter of supreme importance, and I received two notes
from Holmes, dated from Narbonne and from Nimes, from
which I gathered that his stay in France was likely
to be a long one.&#160; It was with some surprise, therefore,
that I saw him walk into my consulting-room upon the
evening of April 24th.&#160; It struck me that he was
looking even paler and thinner than usual.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Yes, I have been using myself
up rather too freely,&#8221; he remarked, in answer
to my look rather than to my words; &#8220;I have been
a little pressed of late.&#160; Have you any objection
to my closing your shutters?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The only light in the room came from
the lamp upon the table at which I had been reading.&#160;
Holmes edged his way round the wall and flinging the
shutters together, he bolted them securely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are afraid of something?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of air-guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Holmes, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I think that you know me well
enough, Watson, to understand that I am by no means
a nervous man.&#160; At the same time, it is stupidity
rather than courage to refuse to recognize danger
when it is close upon you.&#160; Might I trouble you
for a match?&#8221; He drew in the smoke of his cigarette
as if the soothing influence was grateful to him.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I must apologize for calling
so late,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I must further
beg you to be so unconventional as to allow me to
leave your house presently by scrambling over your
back garden wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what does it all mean?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">He held out his hand, and I saw in
the light of the lamp that two of his knuckles were
burst and bleeding.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It is not an airy nothing,
you see,&#8221; said he, smiling.&#160; &#8220;On the
contrary, it is solid enough for a man to break his
hand over.&#160; Is Mrs. Watson in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is away upon a visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#160; You are alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Then it makes it the easier
for me to propose that you should come away with me
for a week to the Continent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, anywhere.&#160; It&#8217;s all the same
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">There was something very strange in
all this.&#160; It was not Holmes&#8217;s nature to
take an aimless holiday, and something about his pale,
worn face told me that his nerves were at their highest
tension.&#160; He saw the question in my eyes, and,
putting his finger-tips together and his elbows upon
his knees, he explained the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have probably never heard of Professor
Moriarty?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Aye, there&#8217;s the genius
and the wonder of the thing!&#8221; he cried.&#160;
&#8220;The man pervades London, and no one has heard
of him.&#160; That&#8217;s what puts him on a pinnacle
in the records of crime.&#160; I tell you, Watson, in
all seriousness, that if I could beat that man, if
I could free society of him, I should feel that my
own career had reached its summit, and I should be
prepared to turn to some more placid line in life.&#160;
Between ourselves, the recent cases in which I have
been of assistance to the royal family of Scandinavia,
and to the French republic, have left me in such a
position that I could continue to live in the quiet
fashion which is most congenial to me, and to concentrate
my attention upon my chemical researches.&#160; But
I could not rest, Watson, I could not sit quiet in
my chair, if I thought that such a man as Professor
Moriarty were walking the streets of London unchallenged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has he done, then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;His career has been an extraordinary
one.&#160; He is a man of good birth and excellent
education, endowed by nature with a phenomenal mathematical
faculty.&#160; At the age of twenty-one he wrote a treatise
upon the Binomial Theorem, which has had a European
vogue.&#160; On the strength of it he won the Mathematical
Chair at one of our smaller universities, and had,
to all appearances, a most brilliant career before
him.&#160; But the man had hereditary tendencies of
the most diabolical kind.&#160; A criminal strain ran
in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was
increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by
his extraordinary mental powers.&#160; Dark rumors
gathered round him in the university town, and eventually
he was compelled to resign his chair and to come down
to London, where he set up as an army coach.&#160;
So much is known to the world, but what I am telling
you now is what I have myself discovered.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;As you are aware, Watson, there
is no one who knows the higher criminal world of London
so well as I do.&#160; For years past I have continually
been conscious of some power behind the malefactor,
some deep organizing power which forever stands in
the way of the law, and throws its shield over the
wrong-doer.&#160; Again and again in cases of the most
varying sorts&#8212;&#173;forgery cases, robberies,
murders&#8212;&#173;I have felt the presence of this
force, and I have deduced its action in many of those
undiscovered crimes in which I have not been personally
consulted.&#160; For years I have endeavored to break
through the veil which shrouded it, and at last the
time came when I seized my thread and followed it,
until it led me, after a thousand cunning windings,
to ex-Professor Moriarty of mathematical celebrity.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He is the Napoleon of crime,
Watson.&#160; He is the organizer of half that is evil
and of nearly all that is undetected in this great
city.&#160; He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract
thinker.&#160; He has a brain of the first order.&#160;
He sits motionless, like a spider in the center of
its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and
he knows well every quiver of each of them.&#160; He
does little himself.&#160; He only plans.&#160; But his
agents are numerous and splendidly organized.&#160;
Is there a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted,
we will say, a house to be rifled, a man to be removed&#8212;&#173;the
word is passed to the Professor, the matter is organized
and carried out.&#160; The agent may be caught.&#160;
In that case money is found for his bail or his defence.&#160;
But the central power which uses the agent is never
caught&#8212;&#173;never so much as suspected.&#160;
This was the organization which I deduced, Watson,
and which I devoted my whole energy to exposing and
breaking up.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;But the Professor was fenced
round with safeguards so cunningly devised that, do
what I would, it seemed impossible to get evidence
which would convict in a court of law.&#160; You know
my powers, my dear Watson, and yet at the end of three
months I was forced to confess that I had at last
met an antagonist who was my intellectual equal.&#160;
My horror at his crimes was lost in my admiration
at his skill.&#160; But at last he made a trip&#8212;&#173;only
a little, little trip&#8212;&#173;but it was more than
he could afford when I was so close upon him.&#160;
I had my chance, and, starting from that point, I
have woven my net round him until now it is all ready
to close.&#160; In three days&#8212;&#173;that is to
say, on Monday next&#8212;&#173;matters will be ripe,
and the Professor, with all the principal members
of his gang, will be in the hands of the police.&#160;
Then will come the greatest criminal trial of the
century, the clearing up of over forty mysteries, and
the rope for all of them; but if we move at all prematurely,
you understand, they may slip out of our hands even
at the last moment.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Now, if I could have done this
without the knowledge of Professor Moriarty, all would
have been well.&#160; But he was too wily for that.&#160;
He saw every step which I took to draw my toils round
him.&#160; Again and again he strove to break away,
but I as often headed him off.&#160; I tell you, my
friend, that if a detailed account of that silent contest
could be written, it would take its place as the most
brilliant bit of thrust-and-parry work in the history
of detection.&#160; Never have I risen to such a height,
and never have I been so hard pressed by an opponent.&#160;
He cut deep, and yet I just undercut him.&#160; This
morning the last steps were taken, and three days
only were wanted to complete the business.&#160; I was
sitting in my room thinking the matter over, when the
door opened and Professor Moriarty stood before me.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My nerves are fairly proof,
Watson, but I must confess to a start when I saw the
very man who had been so much in my thoughts standing
there on my threshhold.&#160; His appearance was quite
familiar to me.&#160; He is extremely tall and thin,
his forehead domes out in a white curve, and his two
eyes are deeply sunken in his head.&#160; He is clean-shaven,
pale, and ascetic-looking, retaining something of
the professor in his features.&#160; His shoulders
are rounded from much study, and his face protrudes
forward, and is forever slowly oscillating from side
to side in a curiously reptilian fashion.&#160; He
peered at me with great curiosity in his puckered
eyes.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You have less frontal
development than I should have expected,&#8217; said
he, at last.&#160; &#8217;It is a dangerous habit to
finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one&#8217;s
dressing-gown.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The fact is that upon his entrance
I had instantly recognized the extreme personal danger
in which I lay.&#160; The only conceivable escape for
him lay in silencing my tongue.&#160; In an instant
I had slipped the revolver from the drawer into my
pocket, and was covering him through the cloth.&#160;
At his remark I drew the weapon out and laid it cocked
upon the table.&#160; He still smiled and blinked,
but there was something about his eyes which made
me feel very glad that I had it there.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You evidently don&#8217;t know me,&#8217;
said he.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;On the contrary,&#8217;
I answered, &#8217;I think it is fairly evident that
I do.&#160; Pray take a chair.&#160; I can spare you
five minutes if you have anything to say.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;All that I have to say
has already crossed your mind,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then possibly my answer has crossed
yours,&#8217; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You stand fast?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Absolutely.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He clapped his hand into his
pocket, and I raised the pistol from the table.&#160;
But he merely drew out a memorandum-book in which he
had scribbled some dates.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You crossed my path
on the 4th of January,&#8217; said he.&#160; &#8217;On
the 23d you incommoded me; by the middle of February
I was seriously inconvenienced by you; at the end
of March I was absolutely hampered in my plans; and
now, at the close of April, I find myself placed in
such a position through your continual persecution
that I am in positive danger of losing my liberty.&#160;
The situation is becoming an impossible one.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Have you any suggestion to make?&#8217;
I asked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You must drop it, Mr.
Holmes,&#8217; said he, swaying his face about.&#160;
&#8217;You really must, you know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;After Monday,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Tut, tut,&#8217; said
he.&#160; &#8217;I am quite sure that a man of your
intelligence will see that there can be but one outcome
to this affair.&#160; It is necessary that you should
withdraw.&#160; You have worked things in such a fashion
that we have only one resource left.&#160; It has been
an intellectual treat to me to see the way in which
you have grappled with this affair, and I say, unaffectedly,
that it would be a grief to me to be forced to take
any extreme measure.&#160; You smile, sir, but I assure
you that it really would.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Danger is part of my trade,&#8217; I
remarked.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;That is not danger,&#8217;
said he.&#160; &#8217;It is inevitable destruction.&#160;
You stand in the way not merely of an individual,
but of a mighty organization, the full extent of which
you, with all your cleverness, have been unable to
realize.&#160; You must stand clear, Mr. Holmes, or
be trodden under foot.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I am afraid,&#8217;
said I, rising, &#8217;that in the pleasure of this
conversation I am neglecting business of importance
which awaits me elsewhere.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;He rose also and looked at
me in silence, shaking his head sadly.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;Well, well,&#8217; said
he, at last.&#160; &#8217;It seems a pity, but I have
done what I could.&#160; I know every move of your
game.&#160; You can do nothing before Monday.&#160;
It has been a duel between you and me, Mr. Holmes.&#160;
You hope to place me in the dock.&#160; I tell you
that I will never stand in the dock.&#160; You hope
to beat me.&#160; I tell you that you will never beat
me.&#160; If you are clever enough to bring destruction
upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;You have paid me several
compliments, Mr. Moriarty,&#8217; said I.&#160; &#8217;Let
me pay you one in return when I say that if I were
assured of the former eventuality I would, in the
interests of the public, cheerfully accept the latter.&#8217;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;&#8216;I can promise you the
one, but not the other,&#8217; he snarled, and so
turned his rounded back upon me, and went peering and
blinking out of the room.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;That was my singular interview
with Professor Moriarty.&#160; I confess that it left
an unpleasant effect upon my mind.&#160; His soft, precise
fashion of speech leaves a conviction of sincerity
which a mere bully could not produce.&#160; Of course,
you will say:&#160; &#8217;Why not take police precautions
against him?&#8217; the reason is that I am well convinced
that it is from his agents the blow will fall.&#160;
I have the best proofs that it would be so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have already been assaulted?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear Watson, Professor Moriarty
is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet.&#160;
I went out about mid-day to transact some business
in Oxford Street.&#160; As I passed the corner which
leads from Bentinck Street on to the Welbeck Street
crossing a two-horse van furiously driven whizzed
round and was on me like a flash.&#160; I sprang for
the foot-path and saved myself by the fraction of
a second.&#160; The van dashed round by Marylebone
Lane and was gone in an instant.&#160; I kept to the
pavement after that, Watson, but as I walked down
Vere Street a brick came down from the roof of one
of the houses, and was shattered to fragments at my
feet.&#160; I called the police and had the place examined.&#160;
There were slates and bricks piled up on the roof
preparatory to some repairs, and they would have me
believe that the wind had toppled over one of these.&#160;
Of course I knew better, but I could prove nothing.&#160;
I took a cab after that and reached my brother&#8217;s
rooms in Pall Mall, where I spent the day.&#160; Now
I have come round to you, and on my way I was attacked
by a rough with a bludgeon.&#160; I knocked him down,
and the police have him in custody; but I can tell
you with the most absolute confidence that no possible
connection will ever be traced between the gentleman
upon whose front teeth I have barked my knuckles and
the retiring mathematical coach, who is, I dare say,
working out problems upon a black-board ten miles away.&#160;
You will not wonder, Watson, that my first act on entering
your rooms was to close your shutters, and that I
have been compelled to ask your permission to leave
the house by some less conspicuous exit than the front
door.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I had often admired my friend&#8217;s
courage, but never more than now, as he sat quietly
checking off a series of incidents which must have
combined to make up a day of horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will spend the night here?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;No, my friend, you might find
me a dangerous guest.&#160; I have my plans laid, and
all will be well.&#160; Matters have gone so far now
that they can move without my help as far as the arrest
goes, though my presence is necessary for a conviction.&#160;
It is obvious, therefore, that I cannot do better
than get away for the few days which remain before
the police are at liberty to act.&#160; It would be
a great pleasure to me, therefore, if you could come
on to the Continent with me.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;The practice is quiet,&#8221;
said I, &#8220;and I have an accommodating neighbor.&#160;
I should be glad to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to start to-morrow morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Oh yes, it is most necessary.&#160;
Then these are your instructions, and I beg, my dear
Watson, that you will obey them to the letter, for
you are now playing a double-handed game with me against
the cleverest rogue and the most powerful syndicate
of criminals in Europe.&#160; Now listen!&#160; You
will dispatch whatever luggage you intend to take by
a trusty messenger unaddressed to Victoria to-night.&#160;
In the morning you will send for a hansom, desiring
your man to take neither the first nor the second which
may present itself.&#160; Into this hansom you will
jump, and you will drive to the Strand end of the
Lowther Arcade, handing the address to the cabman
upon a slip of paper, with a request that he will not
throw it away.&#160; Have your fare ready, and the
instant that your cab stops, dash through the Arcade,
timing yourself to reach the other side at a quarter-past
nine.&#160; You will find a small brougham waiting close
to the curb, driven by a fellow with a heavy black
cloak tipped at the collar with red.&#160; Into this
you will step, and you will reach Victoria in time
for the Continental express.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where shall I meet you?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;At the station.&#160; The second
first-class carriage from the front will be reserved
for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The carriage is our rendezvous, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It was in vain that I asked Holmes
to remain for the evening.&#160; It was evident to
me that he thought he might bring trouble to the roof
he was under, and that that was the motive which impelled
him to go.&#160; With a few hurried words as to our
plans for the morrow he rose and came out with me
into the garden, clambering over the wall which leads
into Mortimer Street, and immediately whistling for
a hansom, in which I heard him drive away.</p>

<p align="justify">In the morning I obeyed Holmes&#8217;s
injunctions to the letter.&#160; A hansom was procured
with such precaution as would prevent its being one
which was placed ready for us, and I drove immediately
after breakfast to the Lowther Arcade, through which
I hurried at the top of my speed.&#160; A brougham
was waiting with a very massive driver wrapped in a
dark cloak, who, the instant that I had stepped in,
whipped up the horse and rattled off to Victoria Station.&#160;
On my alighting there he turned the carriage, and
dashed away again without so much as a look in my direction.</p>

<p align="justify">So far all had gone admirably.&#160;
My luggage was waiting for me, and I had no difficulty
in finding the carriage which Holmes had indicated,
the less so as it was the only one in the train which
was marked &#8220;Engaged.&#8221;&#160; My only source
of anxiety now was the non-appearance of Holmes.&#160;
The station clock marked only seven minutes from the
time when we were due to start.&#160; In vain I searched
among the groups of travellers and leave-takers for
the lithe figure of my friend.&#160; There was no sign
of him.&#160; I spent a few minutes in assisting a
venerable Italian priest, who was endeavoring to make
a porter understand, in his broken English, that his
luggage was to be booked through to Paris.&#160; Then,
having taken another look round, I returned to my
carriage, where I found that the porter, in spite
of the ticket, had given me my decrepit Italian friend
as a traveling companion.&#160; It was useless for me
to explain to him that his presence was an intrusion,
for my Italian was even more limited than his English,
so I shrugged my shoulders resignedly, and continued
to look out anxiously for my friend.&#160; A chill
of fear had come over me, as I thought that his absence
might mean that some blow had fallen during the night.&#160;
Already the doors had all been shut and the whistle
blown, when&#8212;&#173;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear Watson,&#8221; said
a voice, &#8220;you have not even condescended to say
good-morning.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I turned in uncontrollable astonishment.&#160;
The aged ecclesiastic had turned his face towards
me.&#160; For an instant the wrinkles were smoothed
away, the nose drew away from the chin, the lower lip
ceased to protrude and the mouth to mumble, the dull
eyes regained their fire, the drooping figure expanded.&#160;
The next the whole frame collapsed again, and Holmes
had gone as quickly as he had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; I cried; &#8220;how you
startled me!&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Every precaution is still necessary,&#8221;
he whispered.&#160; &#8220;I have reason to think that
they are hot upon our trail.&#160; Ah, there is Moriarty
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">The train had already begun to move
as Holmes spoke.&#160; Glancing back, I saw a tall
man pushing his way furiously through the crowd, and
waving his hand as if he desired to have the train
stopped.&#160; It was too late, however, for we were
rapidly gathering momentum, and an instant later had
shot clear of the station.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;With all our precautions, you
see that we have cut it rather fine,&#8221; said Holmes,
laughing.&#160; He rose, and throwing off the black
cassock and hat which had formed his disguise, he
packed them away in a hand-bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen the morning paper, Watson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t&#8217; seen about Baker Street,
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baker Street?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They set fire to our rooms last night.&#160;
No great harm was done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens, Holmes! this is intolerable.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They must have lost my track
completely after their bludgeon-man was arrested.&#160;
Otherwise they could not have imagined that I had returned
to my rooms.&#160; They have evidently taken the precaution
of watching you, however, and that is what has brought
Moriarty to Victoria.&#160; You could not have made
any slip in coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did exactly what you advised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find your brougham?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you recognize your coachman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It was my brother Mycroft.&#160;
It is an advantage to get about in such a case without
taking a mercenary into your confidence.&#160; But we
must plan what we are to do about Moriarty now.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;As this is an express, and
as the boat runs in connection with it, I should think
we have shaken him off very effectively.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;My dear Watson, you evidently
did not realize my meaning when I said that this man
may be taken as being quite on the same intellectual
plane as myself.&#160; You do not imagine that if I
were the pursuer I should allow myself to be baffled
by so slight an obstacle.&#160; Why, then, should you
think so meanly of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will he do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I should do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you do, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Engage a special.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it must be late.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;By no means.&#160; This train
stops at Canterbury; and there is always at least
a quarter of an hour&#8217;s delay at the boat.&#160;
He will catch us there.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;One would think that we were
the criminals.&#160; Let us have him arrested on his
arrival.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;It would be to ruin the work
of three months.&#160; We should get the big fish,
but the smaller would dart right and left out of the
net.&#160; On Monday we should have them all.&#160;
No, an arrest is inadmissible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall get out at Canterbury.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well, then we must make a cross-country
journey to Newhaven, and so over to Dieppe.&#160; Moriarty
will again do what I should do.&#160; He will get on
to Paris, mark down our luggage, and wait for two days
at the depot.&#160; In the meantime we shall treat
ourselves to a couple of carpet-bags, encourage the
manufactures of the countries through which we travel,
and make our way at our leisure into Switzerland,
via Luxembourg and Basle.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">At Canterbury, therefore, we alighted,
only to find that we should have to wait an hour before
we could get a train to Newhaven.</p>

<p align="justify">I was still looking rather ruefully
after the rapidly disappearing luggage-van which contained
my wardrobe, when Holmes pulled my sleeve and pointed
up the line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Already, you see,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p align="justify">Far away, from among the Kentish woods
there rose a thin spray of smoke.&#160; A minute later
a carriage and engine could be seen flying along the
open curve which leads to the station.&#160; We had
hardly time to take our place behind a pile of luggage
when it passed with a rattle and a roar, beating a
blast of hot air into our faces.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There he goes,&#8221; said
Holmes, as we watched the carriage swing and rock
over the points.&#160; &#8220;There are limits, you
see, to our friend&#8217;s intelligence.&#160; It would
have been a coup-de-maitre had he deduced what I would
deduce and acted accordingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would he have done had he overtaken
us?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;There cannot be the least doubt
that he would have made a murderous attack upon me.&#160;
It is, however, a game at which two may play.&#160;
The question now is whether we should take a premature
lunch here, or run our chance of starving before we
reach the buffet at Newhaven.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">We made our way to Brussels that night
and spent two days there, moving on upon the third
day as far as Strasburg.&#160; On the Monday morning
Holmes had telegraphed to the London police, and in
the evening we found a reply waiting for us at our
hotel.&#160; Holmes tore it open, and then with a bitter
curse hurled it into the grate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might have known it!&#8221; he groaned.&#160;
&#8220;He has escaped!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moriarty?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;They have secured the whole
gang with the exception of him.&#160; He has given
them the slip.&#160; Of course, when I had left the
country there was no one to cope with him.&#160; But
I did think that I had put the game in their hands.&#160;
I think that you had better return to England, Watson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Because you will find me a
dangerous companion now.&#160; This man&#8217;s occupation
is gone.&#160; He is lost if he returns to London.&#160;
If I read his character right he will devote his whole
energies to revenging himself upon me.&#160; He said
as much in our short interview, and I fancy that he
meant it.&#160; I should certainly recommend you to
return to your practice.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">It was hardly an appeal to be successful
with one who was an old campaigner as well as an old
friend.&#160; We sat in the Strasburg <i>salle</i>-&#224;-manger
arguing the question for half an hour, but the same
night we had resumed our journey and were well on
our way to Geneva.</p>

<p align="justify">For a charming week we wandered up
the Valley of the Rhone, and then, branching off at
Leuk, we made our way over the Gemmi Pass, still deep
in snow, and so, by way of Interlaken, to Meiringen.&#160;
It was a lovely trip, the dainty green of the spring
below, the virgin white of the winter above; but it
was clear to me that never for one instant did Holmes
forget the shadow which lay across him.&#160; In the
homely Alpine villages or in the lonely mountain passes,
I could tell by his quick glancing eyes and his sharp
scrutiny of every face that passed us, that he was
well convinced that, walk where we would, we could
not walk ourselves clear of the danger which was dogging
our footsteps.</p>

<p align="justify">Once, I remember, as we passed over
the Gemmi, and walked along the border of the melancholy
Daubensee, a large rock which had been dislodged from
the ridge upon our right clattered down and roared
into the lake behind us.&#160; In an instant Holmes
had raced up on to the ridge, and, standing upon a
lofty pinnacle, craned his neck in every direction.&#160;
It was in vain that our guide assured him that a fall
of stones was a common chance in the spring-time at
that spot.&#160; He said nothing, but he smiled at
me with the air of a man who sees the fulfillment of
that which he had expected.</p>

<p align="justify">And yet for all his watchfulness he
was never depressed.&#160; On the contrary, I can never
recollect having seen him in such exuberant spirits.&#160;
Again and again he recurred to the fact that if he
could be assured that society was freed from Professor
Moriarty he would cheerfully bring his own career
to a conclusion.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;I think that I may go so far
as to say, Watson, that I have not lived wholly in
vain,&#8221; he remarked.&#160; &#8220;If my record
were closed to-night I could still survey it with
equanimity.&#160; The air of London is the sweeter for
my presence.&#160; In over a thousand cases I am not
aware that I have ever used my powers upon the wrong
side.&#160; Of late I have been tempted to look into
the problems furnished by nature rather than those
more superficial ones for which our artificial state
of society is responsible.&#160; Your memoirs will
draw to an end, Watson, upon the day that I crown my
career by the capture or extinction of the most dangerous
and capable criminal in Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">I shall be brief, and yet exact, in
the little which remains for me to tell.&#160; It is
not a subject on which I would willingly dwell, and
yet I am conscious that a duty devolves upon me to
omit no detail.</p>

<p align="justify">It was on the 3d of May that we reached
the little village of Meiringen, where we put up at
the Englischer Hof, then kept by Peter Steiler the
elder.&#160; Our landlord was an intelligent man, and
spoke excellent English, having served for three years
as waiter at the Grosvenor Hotel in London.&#160; At
his advice, on the afternoon of the 4th we set off
together, with the intention of crossing the hills
and spending the night at the hamlet of Rosenlaui.&#160;
We had strict injunctions, however, on no account
to pass the falls of Reichenbach, which are about half-way
up the hill, without making a small detour to see
them.</p>

<p align="justify">It is indeed, a fearful place.&#160;
The torrent, swollen by the melting snow, plunges
into a tremendous abyss, from which the spray rolls
up like the smoke from a burning house.&#160; The shaft
into which the river hurls itself is an immense chasm,
lined by glistening coal-black rock, and narrowing
into a creaming, boiling pit of incalculable depth,
which brims over and shoots the stream onward over
its jagged lip.&#160; The long sweep of green water
roaring forever down, and the thick flickering curtain
of spray hissing forever upward, turn a man giddy
with their constant whirl and clamor.&#160; We stood
near the edge peering down at the gleam of the breaking
water far below us against the black rocks, and listening
to the half-human shout which came booming up with
the spray out of the abyss.</p>

<p align="justify">The path has been cut half-way round
the fall to afford a complete view, but it ends abruptly,
and the traveler has to return as he came.&#160; We
had turned to do so, when we saw a Swiss lad come
running along it with a letter in his hand.&#160; It
bore the mark of the hotel which we had just left,
and was addressed to me by the landlord.&#160; It appeared
that within a very few minutes of our leaving, an
English lady had arrived who was in the last stage
of consumption.&#160; She had wintered at Davos Platz,
and was journeying now to join her friends at Lucerne,
when a sudden hemorrhage had overtaken her.&#160; It
was thought that she could hardly live a few hours,
but it would be a great consolation to her to see an
English doctor, and, if I would only return, <i>etc</i>.&#160;
The good Steiler assured me in a postscript that he
would himself look upon my compliance as a very great
favor, since the lady absolutely refused to see a Swiss
physician, and he could not but feel that he was incurring
a great responsibility.</p>

<p align="justify">The appeal was one which could not
be ignored.&#160; It was impossible to refuse the request
of a fellow-countrywoman dying in a strange land.&#160;
Yet I had my scruples about leaving Holmes.&#160; It
was finally agreed, however, that he should retain
the young Swiss messenger with him as guide and companion
while I returned to Meiringen.&#160; My friend would
stay some little time at the fall, he said, and would
then walk slowly over the hill to Rosenlaui, where
I was to rejoin him in the evening.&#160; As I turned
away I saw Holmes, with his back against a rock and
his arms folded, gazing down at the rush of the waters.&#160;
It was the last that I was ever destined to see of
him in this world.</p>

<p align="justify">When I was near the bottom of the
descent I looked back.&#160; It was impossible, from
that position, to see the fall, but I could see the
curving path which winds over the shoulder of the hill
and leads to it.&#160; Along this a man was, I remember,
walking very rapidly.</p>

<p align="justify">I could see his black figure clearly
outlined against the green behind him.&#160; I noted
him, and the energy with which he walked but he passed
from my mind again as I hurried on upon my errand.</p>

<p align="justify">It may have been a little over an
hour before I reached Meiringen.&#160; Old Steiler
was standing at the porch of his hotel.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Well,&#8221; said I, as I came
hurrying up, &#8220;I trust that she is no worse?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">A look of surprise passed over his
face, and at the first quiver of his eyebrows my heart
turned to lead in my breast.</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;You did not write this?&#8221;
I said, pulling the letter from my pocket.&#160; &#8220;There
is no sick Englishwoman in the hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; he cried.&#160;
&#8220;But it has the hotel mark upon it!&#160; Ha,
it must have been written by that tall Englishman
who came in after you had gone.&#160; He said&#8212;&#173;&#8221;</p>

<p align="justify">But I waited for none of the landlord&#8217;s
explanations.&#160; In a tingle of fear I was already
running down the village street, and making for the
path which I had so lately descended.&#160; It had taken
me an hour to come down.&#160; For all my efforts two
more had passed before I found myself at the fall
of Reichenbach once more.&#160; There was Holmes&#8217;s
Alpine-stock still leaning against the rock by which
I had left him.&#160; But there was no sign of him,
and it was in vain that I shouted.&#160; My only answer
was my own voice reverberating in a rolling echo from
the cliffs around me.</p>

<p align="justify">It was the sight of that Alpine-stock
which turned me cold and sick.&#160; He had not gone
to Rosenlaui, then.&#160; He had remained on that three-foot
path, with sheer wall on one side and sheer drop on
the other, until his enemy had overtaken him.&#160;
The young Swiss had gone too.&#160; He had probably
been in the pay of Moriarty, and had left the two men
together.&#160; And then what had happened?&#160; Who
was to tell us what had happened then?</p>

<p align="justify">I stood for a minute or two to collect
myself, for I was dazed with the horror of the thing.&#160;
Then I began to think of Holmes&#8217;s own methods
and to try to practise them in reading this tragedy.&#160;
It was, alas, only too easy to do.&#160; During our
conversation we had not gone to the end of the path,
and the Alpine-stock marked the place where we had
stood.&#160; The blackish soil is kept forever soft
by the incessant drift of spray, and a bird would
leave its tread upon it.&#160; Two lines of footmarks
were clearly marked along the farther end of the path,
both leading away from me.&#160; There were none returning.&#160;
A few yards from the end the soil was all ploughed
up into a patch of mud, and the branches and ferns
which fringed the chasm were torn and bedraggled.&#160;
I lay upon my face and peered over with the spray
spouting up all around me.&#160; It had darkened since
I left, and now I could only see here and there the
glistening of moisture upon the black walls, and far
away down at the end of the shaft the gleam of the
broken water.&#160; I shouted; but only the same half-human
cry of the fall was borne back to my ears.</p>

<p align="justify">But it was destined that I should
after all have a last word of greeting from my friend
and comrade.&#160; I have said that his Alpine-stock
had been left leaning against a rock which jutted
on to the path.&#160; From the top of this bowlder
the gleam of something bright caught my eye, and, raising
my hand, I found that it came from the silver cigarette-case
which he used to carry.&#160; As I took it up a small
square of paper upon which it had lain fluttered down
on to the ground.&#160; Unfolding it, I found that it
consisted of three pages torn from his note-book and
addressed to me.&#160; It was characteristic of the
man that the direction was a precise, and the writing
as firm and clear, as though it had been written in
his study.</p>

<p align="justify">My dear Watson [it said], I write
these few lines through the courtesy of Mr. Moriarty,
who awaits my convenience for the final discussion
of those questions which lie between us.&#160; He has
been giving me a sketch of the methods by which he
avoided the English police and kept himself informed
of our movements.&#160; They certainly confirm the very
high opinion which I had formed of his abilities.&#160;
I am pleased to think that I shall be able to free
society from any further effects of his presence, though
I fear that it is at a cost which will give pain to
my friends, and especially, my dear Watson, to you.&#160;
I have already explained to you, however, that my
career had in any case reached its crisis, and that
no possible conclusion to it could be more congenial
to me than this.&#160; Indeed, if I may make a full
confession to you, I was quite convinced that the
letter from Meiringen was a hoax, and I allowed you
to depart on that errand under the persuasion that
some development of this sort would follow.&#160; Tell
Inspector Patterson that the papers which he needs
to convict the gang are in pigeonhole M., done up in
a blue envelope and inscribed &#8220;Moriarty.&#8221;&#160;
I made every disposition of my property before leaving
England, and handed it to my brother Mycroft.&#160;
Pray give my greetings to Mrs. Watson, and believe
me to be, my dear fellow,</p>

<p>V&#233;ry sincerely yours,</p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes</p>

<p align="justify">A few words may suffice to tell the
little that remains.&#160; An examination by experts
leaves little doubt that a personal contest between
the two men ended, as it could hardly fail to end
in such a situation, in their reeling over, locked
in each other&#8217;s arms.&#160; Any attempt at recovering
the bodies was absolutely hopeless, and there, deep
down in that dreadful caldron of swirling water and
seething foam, will lie for all time the most dangerous
criminal and the foremost champion of the law of their
generation.&#160; The Swiss youth was never found again,
and there can be no doubt that he was one of the numerous
agents whom Moriarty kept in this employ.&#160; As
to the gang, it will be within the memory of the public
how completely the evidence which Holmes had accumulated
exposed their organization, and how heavily the hand
of the dead man weighed upon them.&#160; Of their terrible
chief few details came out during the proceedings,
and if I have now been compelled to make a clear statement
of his career it is due to those injudicious champions
who have endeavored to clear his memory by attacks
upon him whom I shall ever regard as the best and
the wisest man whom I have ever known.</p>

<h1>Section  2.&#160;  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h1>

<p align="justify">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous
with the free distribution of electronic works in
formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.&#160;
 It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers
and donations from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p align="justify">Volunteers and financial support to
provide volunteers with the assistance they need,
is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection
will remain freely available for generations to come.&#160;
 In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
was created to provide a secure and permanent future
for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.&#160;

Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation

<h1>Section 4.&#160;  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h1>

<p align="justify">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon
and cannot survive without wide spread public support
and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that
can be freely distributed in machine readable form
accessible by the widest array of equipment including
outdated equipment.&#160;  Many small donations ($1
to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining
tax exempt status with the <i>Irs</i>.</p>

<p align="justify">The Foundation is committed to complying
with the laws regulating charities and charitable
donations in all 50 states of the United States.&#160;
 Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes
a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees
to meet and keep up with these requirements.&#160;
 We do not solicit donations in locations where we
have not received written confirmation of compliance.&#160;
 To <i>send</i> <i>donations</i> or determine the status
of compliance for any <i>particular</i> <i>state</i> <i>visit</i>
<i>http</i>://pglaf.org</p>

<p align="justify">While we cannot and do not solicit
contributions from states where we have not met the
solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p align="justify">International donations are gratefully
accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning
tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States.&#160;  U.S. laws alone swamp our small
staff.</p>

<p align="justify">Please check the Project Gutenberg
Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.&#160;
 Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including checks, online payments and credit card donations.&#160;
To donate, please visit:&#160; <i>http</i>://pglaf.org/donate</p>

<p align="justify">Section 5.&#160;  General Information
About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</p>

<p align="justify">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator
of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of
electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone.&#160;  For thirty years, he produced and distributed
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network
of volunteer support.</p>

<p align="justify">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often
created from several printed editions, all of which
are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless
a copyright notice is included.&#160;  Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular
paper edition.</p>

<p align="justify">Most people start at our Web site
which has the main PG search facility:&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>http</i>://<i>www</i>.gutenberg.org</p>

<p align="justify">This Web site includes information
about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make
donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and
how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about
new eBooks. </p>
