designing software so the interface readily incorporates multiple
languages and the vagaries of different character sets &#8212; would be
out of scope for this book.  However, a few lessons for good practice 
do stand out from Unix experience.</p><p>First, <span class="emphasis"><em>separate the message base from the
code</em></span>.  Good Unix practice is to separate the message
strings a program uses from its code. so that message dictionaries
in other languages can be plugged in without modifying the
code.</p><p>The best-known tool for this job is GNU
<i>gettext</i>, which requires that you wrap 
native-language strings that need to be internationalized in
a special macro.  The macro uses each string as a key into per-language
dictionaries which can be supplied as separate files.  If no such
dictionaries are available (or if they are but the string lookup does
not return a match), the macro simply returns its argument, implicitly
falling back on the native language in the code.</p><p>While <i>gettext</i> itself is messy and
fragile as of mid-2003, its general philosophy is sound.  For many
projects, it is possible to craft a lighter-weight version of this
idea with good results.</p><p>Second, there is a clear trend in modern Unixes to scrap all the
historical cruft associated with multiple character sets and make
applications natively speak UTF-8, the 8-bit shift encoding of the
Unicode character set (as opposed to, say, making them natively speak
16-bit wide characters).  The low 128 characters of UTF-8 are ASCII,
and the low 256 are Latin-1, which means this choice is
backward-compatible with the two most widely used character sets.  The
fact that XML and Java have made this choice helps, but the momentum
is present even where XML and Java are not.</p><p>Third, beware of character ranges in regular expressions.  The
element <b>[a-z]</b> will not necessarily catch all
lower-case letters if the script or program it's in is applied to
(say) German, where the sharp-s or ß character is considered
lower-case but does not fall in that range; similar problems arise
with French accented letters. Its safer to use
<b>[[:lower:]]</b>. and other symbolic ranges described in
the POSIX standard.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch17s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="portabilitychapter.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch17s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Programming for Portability </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Portability, Open Standards, and Open Source</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
