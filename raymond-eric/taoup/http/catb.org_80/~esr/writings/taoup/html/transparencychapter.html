</span></i></span></div><p>In the previous chapter we discussed the importance of
textual data formats and application protocols, representations that
are easy for human beings to examine and interact with.  These promote
qualities in design that are much valued in the Unix tradition but
seldom if ever talked about explicitly:
<i>transparency</i><a id="id2911463" class="indexterm"/>
and <i>discoverability</i>.</p><p>Software systems are transparent when they don't have murky
corners or hidden depths.  Transparency is a passive quality.  A
program is transparent when it is possible to form a simple mental
model of its behavior that is actually predictive for all or most
cases, because you can see through the machinery to what is actually
going on.</p><p>Software systems are discoverable when they include features
that are designed to help you build in your mind a correct mental
model of what they do and how they work.  So, for example, good
documentation helps discoverability to a user.  Good choice of
variable and function names helps discoverability to a
programmer. Discoverability<a id="id2911497" class="indexterm"/>
is an active quality. To achieve it in your software you cannot merely
fail to be obscure, you have to go out of your way to be helpful.<sup>[<a id="id2911508" href="#ftn.id2911508">58</a>]</sup>
</p><p>Transparency and discoverability are important for both users
and software developers. But they're important in different ways.
Users like these properties in a UI because they mean an easier
learning curve.  UI transparency and discoverability are a large part
of what people mean when they say a UI is &#8216;intuitive&#8217;;
most of the rest is the Rule of Least Surprise.  We'll examine the
properties that make user interfaces pleasant and effective in more
depth in <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter 11. Interfaces">Chapter 11</a>.</p><p>Software developers like these qualities in the code itself (the
part users don't see) because they so often need to understand it well
enough to modify and debug it.  Also, a program designed so that its
internal data flows are readily comprehensible is more likely to be
one that does not fail because of bad interactions that the designer
didn't notice, and more likely to be able to evolve forward gracefully
(including accommodating change when new maintainers pick up the
baton).</p><p>Transparency is a major component of what David
Gelernter<a id="id2911563" class="indexterm"/>
refers to as &#8220;beauty&#8221; in this chapter's epigraph.  Unix
programmers, borrowing from mathematicians, often use the more
specific term &#8220;elegance&#8221; for the quality Gelernter speaks
of.  Elegance is a combination of power and simplicity.  Elegant code
does much with little.  Elegant code is not only correct but visibly,
<span class="emphasis"><em>transparently</em></span> correct.  It does not merely
communicate an algorithm to a computer, but also conveys insight and
assurance to the mind of a human that reads it.  By seeking elegance
in our code, we build better code.  Learning to write transparent code
is a first, long step toward learning how to write elegant code
&#8212; and taking care to make code discoverable helps us learn how
to make it transparent.  Elegant code is both transparent and
discoverable.</p><p>It may be easier to appreciate the difference between
transparency and discoverability with a pair of extreme examples.  The
Linux<a id="id2911604" class="indexterm"/>
kernel source is remarkably transparent (given the intrinsic
complexity of what it does) but not at all discoverable &#8212;
acquiring the minimum knowledge needed to live in the code and
understand the idiom of the developers is difficult, but once you do
the whole makes sense.<sup>[<a id="id2911617" href="#ftn.id2911617">59</a>]</sup>  On the other hand, the
Emacs Lisp libraries are discoverable but not transparent.  It's easy
to acquire enough knowledge to tweak just one thing, but quite
difficult to comprehend the whole system.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll examine features of Unix designs that
promote transparency and discoverability not just in UIs but in the
parts users don't normally see.  We'll develop some useful rules you
can apply to your coding and development practice.  Later on, in <a href="opensourcechapter.html" title="Chapter 19. Open Source">Chapter 19</a> we'll see how good release-engineering
practices (like having a <tt>README</tt> file with
appropriate content) can make your source code as discoverable as your
design.</p><p>If you need a practical reminder why these qualities are
important, remember that the sanity you save by writing transparent,
discoverable systems may well be that of your own future self.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2911508" href="#id2911508">58</a>] </sup>An economically-minded friend comments: &#8220;Discoverability is
about reducing barriers to entry; transparency is about reducing the 
cost of living in the code&#8221;.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2911617" href="#id2911617">59</a>] </sup>The Linux kernel makes a number
of attempts at discoverability, including the Documentation
subdirectory in the Linux kernel source tarball and quite a number of
tutorial websites and books.  These attempts are frustrated by the
speed at which the kernel changes; the documentation has a chronic
tendency to fall behind.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch05s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="design.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch06s01.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Application Protocol Metaformats </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Studying Cases</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
