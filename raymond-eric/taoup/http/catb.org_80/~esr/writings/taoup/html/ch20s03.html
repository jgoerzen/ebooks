(private namespaces) to its basic set of design ideas.  But are there
serious problems with those basic design ideas? In <a href="philosophychapter.html" title="Chapter 1. Philosophy">Chapter 1</a> we touched on
several issues that Unix arguably got wrong.  Now that the open-source
movement has put the design future of Unix back in the hands of
programmers and technical people, these are no longer decisions we
have to live with forever.  We'll reexamine them in order to get a
better handle on how Unix might evolve in the future.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3015538"/>A Unix File Is Just a Big Bag of Bytes</h3></div></div><p>A Unix file is just a big bag of bytes, with no other 
attributes.  In particular, there is no capability to store
information about the file type or a pointer to an associated
application program outside the file's actual data.</p><p>More generally, everything is a byte stream<a id="id3015556" class="indexterm"/>; even hardware devices are byte streams.
This metaphor was a tremendous success of early Unix, and a real
advance over a world in which (for example) compiled programs could
not produce output that could be fed back to the compiler.
Pipes<a id="id3015569" class="indexterm"/> and shell
programming<a id="id3015577" class="indexterm"/>
sprang from this metaphor.</p><p>But Unix's byte-stream metaphor is <span class="emphasis"><em>so</em></span>
central that Unix has trouble integrating software objects with
operations that don't fit neatly into the byte stream or file
repertoire of operations (create, open, read, write, delete). This is
especially a problem for GUI objects such as icons, windows, and
&#8216;live&#8217; documents.  Within a classical Unix model of the
world, the only way to extend the everything-is-a-byte-stream metaphor
is through <tt>ioctl</tt> calls, a notoriously ugly
collection of back doors into kernel space.</p><p>Fans of the Macintosh<a id="id3015618" class="indexterm"/> family of operating systems tend to be
vociferous about this.  They advocate a model in which a single
filename may have both data and resource &#8216;forks&#8217;, the data
fork corresponding to the Unix byte stream and the resource fork being
a collection of name/value pairs. Unix partisans prefer approaches
that make file data self-describing so that effectively the same sort
of metadata is stored within the file.</p><p>The problem with the Unix approach is that every program
that writes the file has to know about it.  Thus, for example, if we
want the file to carry type information inside it, every tool that
touches it has to take care to either preserve the type field
unaltered or interpret and then rewrite it.  While this would be
theoretically possible to arrange, in practice it would be far too
fragile.</p><p>On the other hand, supporting file attributes raises awkward
questions about which file operations should preserve them.  It's
clear that a copy of a named file to another name should copy
the source file's attributes as well as its data &#8212; but suppose
we
cat(1)
the file, redirecting the output of
cat(1)
to a new name?</p><p>The answer to this question depends on whether the attributes
are actually properties of filenames or are in some magical way
bundled with the file's data as a sort of invisible preamble or
postamble.  Then the question becomes: Which operations make the
properties visible?</p><p>Xerox PARC<a id="id3015686" class="indexterm"/>
file-system designs grappled with this problem as far back as the
1970s. They had an &#8216;open serialized&#8217; call that returned a
byte stream containing both attributes and content.  If applied to a
directory, it returned a serialization of the directory's attributes
plus the serialization of all the files in it.  It is not clear that
this approach has ever been bettered.</p><p>Linux 2.5<a id="id3015706" class="indexterm"/> already supports attaching arbitrary
name/value pairs as properties of a filename, but at time of writing
 this capability is not yet much used by
applications.  Recent versions of Solaris have a roughly equivalent
feature.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3015724"/>Unix Support for GUIs Is Weak</h3></div></div><p>The Unix experience proves that using a handful of metaphors as
the basis for a framework is a powerful strategy (recall the
discussion of frameworks and shared context in <a href="complexitychapter.html" title="Chapter 13. Complexity">Chapter 13</a>).  The visual metaphor at the heart of
modern GUIs (files represented by icons, and opened by clicking which
invokes some designated handler program, typically able to create and
edit these files) has proven both successful and long-lived, exerting
a strong hold on users and interface designers ever since Xerox
PARC<a id="id3015747" class="indexterm"/> pioneered it
in the 1970s.</p><p>Despite considerable recent effort, in 2003 Unix still
supports this metaphor only poorly and grudgingly &#8212; there are
lots of layers, few conventions, and only weak construction utilities.
A typical reaction from a Unix old hand is to suspect that this
reflects deeper problems with the GUI metaphor itself.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>I think part of the problem is that we still don't have the
metaphor right.  For example, on the Mac I drag a file to the
trashcan to delete it, but when I drag it to a disc it gets copied,
and can't drag it to a printer icon to print it because that's done
through the menus.  I could go on and on.  It's like files were in
OS/360, before Unix came along with its simple (but not too simple),
file idea.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

<a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter 11. Interfaces">Chapter 11</a>.  But the inquiry can't stop with
indicting the GUI, because with all its flaws there is tremendous
demand for GUIs from end users.  Supposing we could get the metaphor
right at the level of the design of user interactions, would Unix be
capable of supporting it gracefully?</p><p>The answer is: probably not.  We touched on this problem in
considering whether the bag-of-bytes model is adequate.
Macintosh-style file attributes may help provide the mechanism for
richer support of GUIs, but it seems very unlikely that they are the
whole answer.  Unix's object model doesn't include the right
fundamental constructs.  We need to think through what a really strong
framework for GUIs would be like &#8212; and, just as importantly,
how it can be integrated with the existing frameworks of Unix.  This
is a hard problem, demanding fundamental insights that have yet to
emerge from the noise and confusion of ordinary software engineering
or academic research.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3015838"/>File Deletion Is Forever</h3></div></div><p>People with VMS<a id="id3015847" class="indexterm"/> experience, or who remember
TOPS-20<a id="id3015856" class="indexterm"/> often
miss these systems' file-versioning facilities. Opening an existing file
for write or deleting it actually renamed it in a predictable way
including a version number; only an explicit removal operation on a
version file actually erased data.</p><p>Unix does without this, at a not inconsiderable cost in user
irritation when the wrong files get deleted through a typo or
unexpected effects of shell wildcarding.</p><p>There does not seem to be any foreseeable prospect that this will
change at the operating system level.  Unix developers like clear, simple
operations that do what the user tells them to do, even if the user's
instructions could amount to commanding &#8220;shoot me in the
foot&#8221;.  Their instinct is to say that protecting the user
from himself should be done at the GUI or application level, not
in the operating system.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3015895"/>Unix Assumes a Static File System</h3></div></div><p>Unix has, in one sense, a very static model of the world.
Programs are implicitly assumed to run only briefly, so the
background of files and directories can be assumed static during their
execution.  There is no standard, well-established way to ask the
system to notify an application if and when a specified file or
directory changes.  This becomes a significant issue when writing
long-lived user-interface software which wants to know about changes
to the background.</p><p>Linux has file- and directory-change notification
features,<sup>[<a id="id3015918" href="#ftn.id3015918">156</a>]</sup> and some versions of BSD have copied them, but
these are not yet portable to other Unixes.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3015943"/>The Design of Job Control Was Badly Botched</h3></div></div><p>Apart from the ability to suspend processes (in itself a
trivial addition to the scheduler which could be made fairly
inoffensive) what job control is about is switching a
terminal among multiple processes.  Unfortunately, it does the easiest
part &#8212; deciding where keystrokes go &#8212; and punts all the
hard parts, like saving and restoring the state of the screen, to the
application.</p><p>A really good implementation of such a facility would be
completely invisible to user processes: no dedicated signals, no need
to save and restore terminal modes, no need for the applications to
redraw the screen at random times.  The model ought to be a virtual
keyboard that is sometimes connected to the real one (and blocks you
if you ask for input when it isn't connected) and a virtual screen
which is sometimes visible on the real one (and might or might not
block on output when it's not), with the system doing the multiplexing
in the same way it multiplexes access to the disk, the processor,
etc... and no impact on user programs at all.<sup>[<a id="id3015976" href="#ftn.id3015976">157</a>]</sup></p><p>Doing it right would have required the Unix tty driver to track
the entire current screen state rather than just maintaining a line
buffer, and to know about terminal types at kernel level (possibly
with help from a daemon process) so it could do restores properly when
a suspended process is foregrounded again.  A consequence of doing it
wrong is that the Unix kernel can't detach a session, such as an
<i>xterm</i> or <i>Emacs</i>
job, from one terminal and re-attach it to another (which could be of
a different type).</p><p>As Unix usage has shifted to X displays and terminal emulators,
job control has become relatively less important, and this issue does
not have quite the force it once did.  It is still annoying that there
is no suspend/attach/detach, however; this feature could be useful for
saving the state of terminal sessions between logins.</p><p>A common open-source program called
screen(1)
solves several of these problems.<sup>[<a id="id3016047" href="#ftn.id3016047">158</a>]</sup>
However, since it has to be called explicitly by the user, its
facilities are not guaranteed to be present in every terminal session;
also, the kernel-level code that overlaps with it in function has not been
removed.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3016077"/>The Unix API Doesn't Use Exceptions</h3></div></div><p>C lacks a facility for throwing named exceptions with attached
data.<sup>[<a id="id3016087" href="#ftn.id3016087">159</a>]</sup>  Thus, the C functions in the Unix API
indicate errors by returning a distinguished value (usually &#8722;1 or a
NULL character pointer) and setting a global errno variable.</p><p>In retrospect, this is the source of many subtle errors.
Programmers in a hurry often neglect to check return values.  Because
no exception is thrown, the Rule of Repair is violated; program flow
continues until the error condition manifests as some kind of failure
or data corruption later in execution.</p><p>The absence of exceptions also means that some tasks which ought 
to be simple idioms &#8212; like aborting from a signal handler on a
version with Berkeley-style signals &#8212; have to be performed with
code that is complex, subject to portability glitches, and bug-prone.</p><p>This problem can be (and normally is) hidden by bindings of the
Unix API in languages such as Python or Java that have exceptions.</p><p>The lack of exceptions is actually an indicator of a problem
with larger immediate implications; C's weak type ontology
makes communication between higher-level languages implemented in
it problematic.  Most of the more modern languages, for example, have 
lists and dictionaries as primary data types &#8212; but, because
these don't have any canonical representation in the universe of C, 
attempting to pass lists between (say) Perl and Python is an unnatural
act requiring a lot of glue.</p><p>There are technologies that address the larger problem, such as CORBA,
but they tend to involve a lot of runtime translation and be
unpleasantly heavyweight.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3016155"/>ioctl(2) and fcntl(2) Are an Embarrassment</h3></div></div><p>The ioctl(2) and fcntl(2) mechanisms provide a way to write
hooks into a device driver.  The original, historical use of ioctl(2)
was to set parameters like baud rate and number of framing bits in a
serial-communications driver, thus the name (for &#8216;I/O
control&#8217;).  Later, ioctl calls were added for other driver
functions, and fcntl(2) was added as a hook into the
file system.</p><p>Over the years, <tt>ioctl</tt> and
<tt>fcntl</tt> calls have proliferated.  They are
often poorly documented, and often a source of portability problems as
well.  With each one comes a grubby pile of macro definitions
describing operation types and special argument values.</p><p>The underlying problem is the same as &#8216;big bag of
bytes&#8217;; Unix's object model is weak, leaving no natural places
to put many auxiliary operations.  Designers have an untidy choice
among unsatisfactory alternatives; <tt>fcntl</tt>/<tt>ioctl</tt> going
through devices in <tt>/dev</tt>, new
special-purpose system calls, or hooks through special-purpose virtual
file systems that hook into the kernel (e.g. <tt>/proc</tt> under Linux and elsewhere).</p><p>It is not clear whether or how Unix's object model will be
enriched in the future.  If MacOS-like file attributes become a common
feature of Unix, tweaking magic named attributes on device drivers may
take over the role <tt>ioctl</tt>/<tt>fcntl</tt> now have (this would at least have the
merit of not requiring piles of macro definitions before the interface
could be used).  We've already seen that Plan 9, which uses the named
file server or file system as its basic object, rather than the
file/bytestream, presents another possible path.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3019078"/>The Unix Security Model May Be Too Primitive</h3></div></div><p>Perhaps root is too powerful, and Unix should have finer-grained
capabilities or ACLs (Access Control Lists) for system-administration
functions, rather than one superuser that can do anything.  People who
take this position argue that too many system programs have permanent
root privileges through the set-user-ID mechanism; if even one can be
compromised, intrusions everywhere will follow.</p><p>This argument is weak, however.  Modern Unixes allow any given
user account to belong to multiple security groups.  Through use of
the execute-permission and set-group-ID bits on program executables,
each group can in effect function as an ACL for files or programs.</p><p>This theoretical possibility is very little used, however,
suggesting that the demand for ACLs is much less in practice than it
is in theory.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3019113"/>Unix Has Too Many Different Kinds of Names</h3></div></div><p>Unix unified files and local devices &#8212; they're all just
