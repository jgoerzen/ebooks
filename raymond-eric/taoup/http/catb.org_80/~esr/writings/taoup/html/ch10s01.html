configuration, we should ask a high-level question: What things should 
be configurable?</p><p>The gut-level Unix answer is &#8220;everything&#8221;.  The
Rule of Separation that we discussed in <a href="philosophychapter.html" title="Chapter 1. Philosophy">Chapter 1</a> encourages Unix programmers to build
mechanism and defer policy decisions outward toward the user wherever
possible.  While this tends to produce programs that are powerful and
rewarding for expert users, it also tends to produce interfaces that
overwhelm novices and casual users with a surfeit of choices, and with
configuration files sprouting like weeds.</p><p>Unix programmers aren't going to be cured of their tendency to
design for their peers and the most sophisticated users any time soon
(we'll grapple a bit with the question of whether such a change would
actually be desirable in <a href="futurechapter.html" title="Chapter 20. Futures">Chapter 20</a>).  So it's perhaps more useful to invert the
question and ask &#8220;What things should <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be
configurable?&#8221; Unix practice does offer some guidelines on
this.</p><p>First, <span class="emphasis"><em>don't provide configuration switches for what
you can reliably detect automatically</em></span>. This is a
surprisingly common mistake.  Instead, look for ways to eliminate
configuration switches by autodetection, or by trying alternative
methods at runtime until one succeeds. If this strikes you as
inelegant or too expensive, ask yourself if you haven't fallen into
premature optimization.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>One of the nicest examples of autodetection I experienced was
when Dennis Ritchie and I were porting Unix to the Interdata 8/32.
This was a big-endian machine, and we had to generate data for that
machine on a PDP-11, write a magnetic tape, and then load the magnetic
tape on the Interdata.  A common error was to forget to twiddle the
byte order; a checksum error showed you that you had to unmount,
remount again on the PDP-11, regenerate the tape, unmount, and
remount.  Then one day Dennis hacked the Interdata tape reader program
so that if it got a checksum error it rewound the tape, toggled
&#8216;byte flip&#8217; switch and reread it.  A second checksum error
would kill the load, but 99% of the time it just read the tape and did
the right thing.  Our productivity shot up, and we pretty much ignored
tape byte order from that point on.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

</span></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div><p>A good rule of thumb is this: Be adaptive unless doing so costs
you 0.7 seconds or more of latency.  0.7 seconds is a magic number
because, as Jef Raskin discovered while designing the Canon Cat,
humans are almost incapable of noticing startup latency shorter than
that; it gets lost in the mental overhead of changing the focus of
attention.</p><p>Second, <span class="emphasis"><em>users should not see optimization
switches</em></span>.  As a designer, it's <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span>
job to make the program run economically, not the user's.  The
marginal gains in performance that a user might collect from
optimization switches are usually not worth the interface-complexity
cost.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>File-format nonsense (record length, blocking factor, etc)
was blessedly eschewed by Unix, but the same kind of
thing has roared back in excess configuration goo.  KISS became
MICAHI: make it complicated and hide it.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

be done with a script wrapper or a trivial pipeline</em></span>.  Don't
put complexity inside your program when you can easily enlist other
programs to help get the work done. (Recall our discussion in <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter 7. Multiprogramming">Chapter 7</a> of why
ls(1)
does not have a built-in pager, or an option to invoke it).</p><p>Here are some more general questions to consider whenever you
find yourself thinking about adding a configuration option:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Can I leave this feature out?  Why am I
fattening the manual and burdening the user?</p></li><li><p>Could the program's normal behavior be changed in an
innocuous way that would make the option unnecessary?</p></li><li><p>Is this option merely cosmetic?  Should I be thinking
less about how to make the user interface configurable and more 
about how to make it right?
</p></li><li><p>Should the behavior enabled by this option be
a separate program instead?</p></li></ul></div><p>Proliferating unnecessary options has many bad effects.  One of
the subtlest but most serious is what it will do to your test
coverage.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Unless it is done very carefully, the addition of an on/off
configuration option can lead to a need to double the amount of
testing.  Since in practice one never does double the amount of
testing, the practical effect is to reduce the amount of testing that
any given configuration receives.  Ten options leads to 1024 times as
much testing, and pretty soon you are talking real reliability
problems.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">
