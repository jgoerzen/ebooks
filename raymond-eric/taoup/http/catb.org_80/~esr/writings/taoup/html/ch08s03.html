We've observed
that minilanguages offer a way to push problem specifications to a
higher level, and seen how this operates in several case studies.  The
flip side of this observation is that a minilanguage is likely to be a
good approach whenever the domain primitives in your application area
are simple and stereotyped, but the ways in which users are likely to
want to apply them are fluid and varying.</p><p>For some related ideas, find a description of the <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlternateHardAndSoftLayers" target="_top">Alternate
Hard And Soft Layers</a> and <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~np2/patterns/scripting/scripting.html" target="_top">Scripted
Components</a> design patterns.</p><p>An interesting survey of design styles and techniques in
minilanguages is <a id="id2936393" class="indexterm"/> <i>Notable Design Patterns for
Domain-Specific Languages</i> [<a href="apb.html#Spinellis" title="[Spinellis]">Spinellis</a>].</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2936413"/>Choosing the Right Complexity Level</h3></div></div><p>The first important thing to bear in mind when designing a
minilanguage is, as usual, to keep it as simple as possible.  The
taxonomy diagram we used to organize the case studies implies a
hierarchy of complexity; you want to keep your design as far toward the
left-hand edge as possible.  If you can get away with designing a
structured data file rather than a minilanguage that is going to
modify external data when it's interpreted, by all means do
so.</p><p>One very pragmatic reason to stick with structured data rather
than a minilanguage is that in a networked world, embedded
minilanguage facilities are subject to abuses that can be inconvenient
or even dangerous.  JavaScript<a id="id2936439" class="indexterm"/> is a prime example in the
&#8216;inconvenient&#8217; category; its designers didn't anticipate
that it would be used for pop-up advertisements so obnoxious as to
create a demand for browser features that suppress JavaScript
interpretation.</p><p>Microsoft Word<a id="id2936456" class="indexterm"/> macro viruses show how this sort of thing
can become actively dangerous, a security hole that costs billions of
dollars in downtime and lost productivity annually.  It is instructive
to note that despite the existence of at least twenty million Unix
users worldwide<sup>[<a id="id2936473" href="#ftn.id2936473">95</a>]</sup> there has never been any Unix equivalent
of Windows's frequent macro-virus outbreaks.  There are a number of
reasons for this, including the fundamentally better security design
of Unix; but at least one is the fact that Unix mail agents do
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> default to executing live content in any
document that the user
views.<sup>[<a id="id2936490" href="#ftn.id2936490">96</a>]</sup></p><p>If there is any way that your application's users might end up
running programs from untrusted sources, risky features of your
application minilanguage might end up having to be suppressed.
Languages like Java and JavaScript are explicitly
<i>sandboxed</i>&#8212;that is, they have limited
access to their environment not merely to simplify their design but to
try to prevent potentially destructive operations by buggy or
malicious code.</p><p>On the other hand, a lot of bad designs have been
botched by designers who failed to face up to the fact that they
really needed a minilanguage rather than a data-file format.  Too
often, language-like features get pasted on as an afterthought.
The two most common symptoms of this problem are weak, ad-hoc control
structures and poor or nonexistent facilities for declaring
procedures.</p><p>It's risky to design minilanguages that are only accidentally
Turing-complete.  If you do this the odds are good that, sometime in
the future, some clever fellow is going to think he needs to press 
your language into doing loops and conditionals for him.  Because
these are only available in an obfuscated way, he'll produce
obfuscated code. The results may be serviceable in the short term, 
but are likely to be a nightmare for those who come after him.</p><p>Minilanguage design is both powerful and esthetically rewarding,
but it's also full of similar traps.  There are kinds of design in
which it is appropriate to take the bottom-up approach of pasting
together a bunch of low-level services and worrying about their
organization after you have explored the problem domain for a
while.  One of the virtues of minilanguages is that they can help you
get a good design out of bottom-up programming by allowing you to
defer some top-down decisions into the control flow of programs in
your minilanguage.  But if you take a bottom-up approach to the minilanguage
design <span class="emphasis"><em>itself</em></span>, you are likely to end up with an
ugly syntax reflecting a weak language and a poorly-thought-out
implementation.</p><p>There are many places in a minilanguage design where small
choices make a large difference in the useability and ease of the
tool:</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>As a language designer, it is a good principle to consider the
alternatives to giving an error message.  When there is true ambiguity
in the intent of the programmer an error message is appropriate, but
in many cases the intent is clear, and making the language silently do
the right thing is a great boon.  A good example is C accommodating an
extra comma at the end of an array initializer list, which makes both
editing and machine generation of array initializers much easier.
Anti-examples are the pickiness of various HTML readers, especially
their habit of silently discarding parts of your document because of
trivial nesting errors.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

</span></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div><p>On this issue, as elsewhere, there is no substitute for good
taste and engineering judgment.  If you're going to design a
minilanguage, don't do it halfway.  Declarative minilanguages should
have a clear, consistent language-like syntax designed to be readable
by humans.  Imperative ones should add a full range of control
structures adapted from language models you can expect your users to
be familiar with.  Think about the language <span class="emphasis"><em>as</em></span> a
language; ask yourself esthetic questions like &#8220;Will this be
comfortable to program in?&#8221; and even &#8220;Will it be pleasant
to look at?&#8221; Here, as elsewhere in software design, David
Gelernter's maxim is apt: beauty is the ultimate defense against
complexity.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2936650"/>Extending and Embedding Languages</h3></div></div><p>One fundamentally important question is whether you can
implement your minilanguage by extending or embedding an existing
scripting language<a id="id2936662" class="indexterm"/>.  This is often the right way to go
for an imperative minilanguage, but much less appropriate for a
declarative one.</p><p>Sometimes it's possible to write your imperative language simply
by coding service functions in an interpreted language, which we'll
call the &#8216;host&#8217; language for purposes of this
discussion. Your minilanguage programs are then just scripts that load
your service library and use the host language's control structures
and other facilities as a framework.  Every facility the host language
supplies is one you don't have to write.</p><p>This is the easiest way to write a minilanguage.  Old-school
Lisp<a id="id2936690" class="indexterm"/>
programmers (including me) love this technique and use it heavily.  It
underlies the design of the <i>Emacs</i> editor,
and has been rediscovered in the new-school scripting languages like
Tcl<a id="id2936708" class="indexterm"/>,
Python<a id="id2936717" class="indexterm"/>, and
Perl<a id="id2936725" class="indexterm"/>. There are
drawbacks to it, however.</p><p>Your host language may be unable to interface to a code library
that you need.  Or, internally, its ontology of data types may be
inadequate for the kind of computation you need to do.  Or, after
measuring the performance of a prototype, you discover that it's too
slow.  When any of these things happen, your solution is usually
going to involve coding in C<a id="id2936745" class="indexterm"/> (or
C++<a id="id2936753" class="indexterm"/>) and integrating the
results into your minilanguage.</p><p>The option of extending a scripting
language<a id="id2936768" class="indexterm"/>
with C code, or of embedding a scripting language in a C program,
relies on the existence of scripting languages designed for it.  You
extend a scripting language by telling it to dynamically load a C
library or module in such a way that the C entry points become visible
as functions in the extended language.  You embed a scripting language
in a C program by sending commands to an instance of the interpreter
and receiving the results back as values in C.</p><p>Both techniques also rely on the ability to move data between
the type ontology of C and the type ontology of your scripting
language.  Some scripting languages are designed from the ground up to
support this.  One such is Tcl<a id="id2936793" class="indexterm"/>, which we'll cover in <a href="languageschapter.html" title="Chapter 14. Languages">Chapter 14</a>.  Another is
<i>Guile</i>, an open-source dialect of the
Lisp<a id="id2936815" class="indexterm"/> variant
Scheme.  <i>Guile</i> is shipped as a library and
specifically designed to be embedded in C<a id="id2936832" class="indexterm"/> programs.</p><p>It is possible (though in 2003 still rather painful and
difficult) to extend or embed Perl<a id="id2936846" class="indexterm"/>.  It is very easy to extend
Python<a id="id2936854" class="indexterm"/> and
only slightly more difficult to embed it; C extension is especially
heavily used in the Python world.  Java<a id="id2936865" class="indexterm"/> has an interface to call &#8216;native
methods&#8217; in C, though the practice is explicitly discouraged
because it tends to break portability.  Most versions of shell are not
designed for embeddability and extension, but the Korn shell (ksh93
and later versions) is a notable exception.</p><p>There are lots of bad reasons not to piggyback your imperative
minilanguage on an existing scripting
language<a id="id2936885" class="indexterm"/>.
One of the few good ones is that you actually want to implement your own
custom grammar for error checking.  If that's the case, then see the
advice about <i>yacc</i> and
<i>lex</i> below.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2936912"/>Writing a Custom Grammar</h3></div></div><p>For declarative minilanguages, one major question is whether or
not you should use XML as a base syntax and specify your grammar as an
XML document type.  This may well be the right thing for elaborately
structured declarative minilanguages, but the same caveats we noted in
<a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter 5. Textuality">Chapter 5</a> about the
design of data-file formats apply &#8212; XML might be overkill.  If
you don't use XML, follow the Rule of Least Surprise by supporting the
Unix conventions we described for data files (simple token-oriented
syntax, supporting C<a id="id2936939" class="indexterm"/> backslash conventions, etc.).</p><p>If you do need a custom grammar, <i>yacc</i>
and <i>lex</i> (or their local equivalent in the
language you're using) should probably be your best friends, unless
the grammar of your language is so simple that hand-coding a
recursive-descent parser is trivial. Even then,
<i>yacc</i> may give you better error recovery,
and a <i>yacc</i> specification will be easier to
modify as the language syntax evolves.  See <a href="generationchapter.html" title="Chapter 9. Generation">Chapter 9</a> for a look at the
<i>yacc</i>- and
<i>lex</i>-derived tools available in different
implementation languages.</p><p>Even if you decide you must implement your own syntax, consider
what mileage you can get from reusing existing tools.  If you need a
macro facility, consider whether preprocessing with
m4(1)
might be the right answer &#8212; but consider the cautions in the
next section first.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="macroexpansion"/>Macros &#8212; Beware!</h3></div></div><p>Macro expansion facilities were a favored tactic for language
designers in early Unix; the C<a id="id2937039" class="indexterm"/>
language has one, of course, and we have seen them show up in some of
the more complex special-purpose minilanguages like
pic(1).
The <i>m4</i> preprocessor provides a generic tool for implementing
macro-expanding preprocessors.</p><p>Macro expansion is easy to specify and implement, and you can do
a lot of cute tricks with it.  Those early designers appear to have been
influenced by experience with assemblers, in which macro facilities
were often the only device available for structuring programs.</p><p>The strength of macro expansion is that it knows nothing about
the underlying syntax of the base language, and can be used to extend
that syntax.  Unfortunately, this power is very easily abused to
produce code that is opaque, surprising, and a fertile source of
hard-to-characterize bugs.</p><p>In C, the classic example of this sort of problem is a macro
such as this:</p><pre class="programlisting">
#define max(x, y)	x &gt; y ? x : y
</pre><p>There are at least two problems with this macro.  One is that it
can produce surprising results if either of the arguments is an
expression including an operator of lower precedence than <tt>&gt;</tt> or <tt>?:</tt>.
Consider the expression <tt>max(a = b,
++c)</tt>.  If the programmer has forgotten that <tt>max</tt> is a macro, he will be expecting the
assignment <tt>a = b</tt> and the preincrement
operation on <tt>c</tt> to be executed before
the resulting values are passed as arguments to <tt>max</tt>.</p><p>But that's not what will happen.  Instead, the preprocessor will
expand this expression to <tt>a = b &gt; ++c ? a = b :
++c</tt>, which the C compiler's precedence rules make it
interpret as <tt>a = (b &gt; ++c ? a = b :
++c)</tt>.  The effect will be to assign to <tt>a</tt>!</p><p>This sort of bad interaction can be headed off by coding the
macro definition more defensively.</p><pre class="programlisting">
#define max(x, y)	((x) &gt; (y) ? (x) : (y))
</pre><p>With this definition, the expansion would be <tt>((a = b) &gt; (++c) ? (a = b) : (++c))</tt>.  This
solves one problem &#8212; but notice that <tt>c</tt> may be incremented twice!  There are subtler
versions of this trap, such as passing the macro a function-call with
side effects.</p><p>In general, interactions between macros and expressions with
side effects can lead to unfortunate results that are hard to
diagnose.  C's macro processor is a deliberately lightweight and
simple one; more powerful ones can actually get you in worse
trouble.</p><p>The <i>TeX</i> formatting
language (see <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter 18. Documentation">Chapter 18</a>) well illustrates the general
problem.  <i>TeX</i> is intentionally
Turing-complete (it has conditionals, loops, and recursion), but while
it can be made to do amazing things, <i>TeX</i> code tends to be unreadable and
painful to debug.  The sources for <i>LaTeX</i>, the the most widely used <i>TeX</i> macro package, are an instructive
example: they're in very good <i>TeX</i> style, but even so are extremely
difficult to follow.</p><p>A minor problem, compared to this one, is that macro expansion
tends to screw up error diagnostics.  The base language processor
generates its error reports relative to the macro expanded text, not
the original the programmer is looking at.  If the relationship
between the two has been obfuscated by macro expansion, the emitted
diagnostic can be very difficult to associate with the actual
location of the error.</p><p>This is especially a problem with preprocessors and macros
that can have multiline expansions, conditionally include or exclude
text, or otherwise change line numbers in the expanded text. </p><p>Macro expansion stages that are built into a language can do
their own compensation, fiddling line numbers to refer back to the
preexpanded text.  The macro facility in
pic(1)
does this, for example.  This problem is more difficult to solve when
the macro expansion is done by a preprocessor.</p><p>The C preprocessor<a id="id2937381" class="indexterm"/>
addresses this problem by emitting <tt>#line</tt> directives whenever it does an inclusion
or multiline expansion. The C compiler is expected to interpret these
and adjust the line numbers in its error reports accordingly.
Unfortunately, <i>m4</i> has no such
facility.</p><p>These are reasons to use macro expansion with extreme caution.  
One of the long-term lessons of the Unix experience is that macros
tend to create more problems than they solve.  Modern language and
minilanguage designs have moved away from them.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2937424"/>Language or Application Protocol?</h3></div></div><p>Another important question you need to ask is whether your
minilanguage engine will be called interactively by other
programs, as a slave process.  If so, your design should probably look
less like a conversational language for human interaction and more
like the kind of application protocols we looked at in <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter 5. Textuality">Chapter 5</a>.</p><p>The main difference is how carefully marked the boundaries
of transactions are.  Human beings are good at spotting where
conversational output from a CLI ends, and where the prompt for the
next input is.  They can use context to tell what's significant and
what should be ignored.  Computer programs have much more trouble with 
this.  Without either unambiguous end markers on output or advance
knowledge of the length of the output, they can't tell when to stop
reading.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Even worse is when a program's input is buffered (often

things with slaved minilanguages that are not carefully designed
around this problem are prone to deadlock as the master and slave fall
out of synchronization (a problem we first noted in <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter 7. Multiprogramming">Chapter 7</a>).</p><p>There are workarounds for driving minilanguages that are not so
carefully designed.  The prototype for most of them is the
Tcl<a id="id2937516" class="indexterm"/>
<i>expect</i> package.  This package 
assists conversation with CLIs.  It's built around the following
operation: read from slave until either a given regular-expression
pattern is matched or a specified timeout elapses.  With this (and, of
course, a send-to-slave operation) it's often possible to construct
master programs to do reliable dialogues with slave processes even
when the latter have not been tailored for the role.</p><p>Workalikes of the <i>expect</i> package in
other languages are available; a Web search for the name of your
favorite language with the added keywords &#8220;Tcl expect&#8221; is
quite likely to turn up something useful.  As a minilanguage designer,
however, you would be unwise to assume that all your users will be
<i>expect</i> gurus. Even if they are, this is an
extra glue layer and a place for things to go wrong.</p><p>Be aware of this issue when designing your minilanguage.  It may
be a good idea to add an option that changes its conversational
behavior to make it respond more like an application protocol, with
unambiguous end-of-output delimiters and an analog of
