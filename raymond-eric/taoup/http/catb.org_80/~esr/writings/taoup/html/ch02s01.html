the successors of small experimental prototypes.  The urge to add
everything that was left out the first time around all too frequently
leads to huge and overcomplicated design.  Less well known, because
less common, is the &#8216;third-system effect&#8217;; sometimes,
after the second system has collapsed of its own weight, there is a
chance to go back to simplicity and get it really right.</p><p>The original Unix was a third system.  Its grandfather was the
small and simple Compatible Time-Sharing System
(CTSS)<a id="id2881275" class="indexterm"/>, either the first
or second timesharing system ever deployed (depending on some
definitional questions we are going to determinedly ignore).  Its
father was the pioneering
Multics<a id="id2881286" class="indexterm"/> project, an
attempt to create a feature-packed &#8216;information utility&#8217;
that would gracefully support interactive timesharing of mainframe
computers by large communities of users. Multics, alas, did
collapse of its own weight.  But Unix was born from that collapse.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="genesis"/>Genesis: 1969&#8211;1971</h3></div></div><a id="id2881306" class="indexterm"/><a id="id2881317" class="indexterm"/><p>Unix was born in 1969 out of the mind of a computer scientist at
Bell Laboratories<a id="id2881333" class="indexterm"/>, Ken Thompson.  Thompson had been a
researcher on the Multics project, an experience which spoiled him for
the primitive batch computing that was the rule almost everywhere
else.  But the concept of timesharing was still a novel one in the late
1960s; the first speculations on it had been uttered barely ten years
earlier by computer scientist John McCarthy (also the inventor of the
Lisp<a id="id2881351" class="indexterm"/> language),
the first actual deployment had been in 1962, seven years earlier, and
timesharing operating systems were still experimental and
temperamental beasts.</p><p>Computer hardware was at that time more primitive than even
people who were there to see it can now easily recall.  The most
powerful machines of the day had less computing power and internal
memory than a typical cellphone of today.<sup>[<a id="id2881371" href="#ftn.id2881371">13</a>]</sup>
Video display terminals were in their infancy and would not be widely
deployed for another six years.  The standard interactive device on
the earliest timesharing systems was the ASR-33 teletype &#8212; a
slow, noisy device that printed upper-case-only on big rolls of yellow
paper.  The ASR-33 was the natural parent of the Unix tradition of
terse commands and sparse responses.</p><p>When Bell Labs withdrew from the Multics research consortium,
Ken Thompson was left with some Multics-inspired ideas about how to
build a file system.  He was also left without a machine on which to
play a game he had written called Space Travel, a science-fiction
simulation that involved navigating a rocket through the solar
system. Unix began its life on a scavenged
PDP-7<a id="id2881401" class="indexterm"/>
minicomputer<sup>[<a id="id2881412" href="#ftn.id2881412">14</a>]</sup> like the one shown in <a href="#pdp7" title="Figure 2.1. The PDP-7.">Figure 2.1</a>, as a platform for the Space Travel game and a
testbed for Thompson's ideas about operating system design.</p><div class="figure"><a id="pdp7"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 2.1. The PDP-7.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/pdp7.jpg" alt="The PDP-7."/></div><a id="id2881463" class="indexterm"/></div><p>The full origin story is told in [<a href="apb.html#Ritchie79" title="[Ritchie79]">Ritchie79</a>] from the point of view of
Thompson's first collaborator, Dennis Ritchie, the man who would
become known as the co-inventor of Unix and the inventor of the
C<a id="id2881494" class="indexterm"/> language.
Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy<a id="id2881502" class="indexterm"/>, and a few colleagues had become used to
interactive computing under
Multics<a id="id2881512" class="indexterm"/> and did not
want to lose that capability.  Thompson's PDP-7 operating system
offered them a lifeline.</p><p>Ritchie observes: &#8220;What we wanted to preserve was not just
a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around
which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the
essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access,
time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal
instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication&#8221;.
The theme of computers being viewed not merely as logic devices but as
the nuclei of communities was in the air; 1969 was also the year the
ARPANET (the direct ancestor of today's Internet) was invented. The theme
of &#8220;fellowship&#8221; would resonate all through Unix's
subsequent history.</p><p>Thompson and Ritchie's Space Travel implementation attracted
notice.  At first, the PDP-7's software had to be cross-compiled on a
GE mainframe.  The utility programs that Thompson and Ritchie wrote to
support hosting game development on the PDP-7 itself became the core
of Unix &#8212; though the name did not attach itself until 1970.  The
original spelling was &#8220;UNICS&#8221; (UNiplexed Information
and Computing Service), which Ritchie later described as &#8220;a
somewhat treacherous pun on Multics&#8221;, which stood for
MULTiplexed Information and Computing
Service<a id="id2879500" class="indexterm"/>.</p><p>Even at its earliest stages, PDP-7 Unix bore a strong
resemblance to today's Unixes and provided a rather more
pleasant programming environment than was available anywhere else in
those days of card-fed batch mainframes.  Unix was very close to being
the first system under which a programmer could sit down directly at a
machine and compose programs on the fly, exploring possibilities and
testing while composing.  All through its lifetime Unix has had a pattern
of growing more capabilities by attracting highly skilled volunteer
efforts from programmers impatient with the limitations of other
operating systems.  This pattern was set early, within Bell Labs
itself.</p><p>The Unix tradition of lightweight development and informal
methods also began at its beginning.  Where Multics had been a large
project with thousands of pages of technical specifications written
before the hardware arrived, the first running Unix code was
brainstormed by three people and implemented by Ken
Thompson<a id="id2879536" class="indexterm"/> in two
days &#8212; on an obsolete machine that had been designed to be a
graphics terminal for a &#8216;real&#8217; computer.</p><p>Unix's first real job, in 1971, was to support what would now be
called word processing for the Bell Labs patent department; the first
Unix application was the ancestor of the
nroff(1)
text formatter.  This project justified the purchase of a
PDP-11<a id="id2879563" class="indexterm"/>, a much
more capable minicomputer.  Management remained blissfully unaware
that the word-processing system that Thompson and colleagues were
building was incubating an operating system.  Operating systems were
not in the Bell Labs plan &#8212;
AT&amp;T<a id="id2879579" class="indexterm"/> had joined
the Multics consortium precisely to avoid doing an operating
system on its own.  Nevertheless, the completed system was a rousing
success.  It established Unix as a permanent and valued part of the
computing ecology at Bell Labs, and began another theme in Unix's
history &#8212; a close association with document-formatting,
typesetting, and communications tools.  The 1972 manual claimed 10
installations.</p><p>Later, Doug McIlroy<a id="id2879599" class="indexterm"/> would write of this period [<a href="apb.html#McIlroy91" title="[McIlroy91]">McIlroy91</a>]: &#8220;Peer pressure and simple pride in
workmanship caused gobs of code to be rewritten or discarded as better
or more basic ideas emerged. Professional rivalry and protection of
turf were practically unknown: so many good things were happening that
nobody needed to be proprietary about innovations&#8221;. But it
would take another quarter century for all the implications of that
observation to come home.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2879627"/>Exodus: 1971&#8211;1980</h3></div></div><p>The original Unix operating system was written in assembler, and
the applications in a mix of assembler and an interpreted language
called B, which had the virtue that it was small enough to run on the
PDP-7<a id="id2879640" class="indexterm"/>.  But B
was not powerful enough for systems programming, so Dennis Ritchie
added data types and structures to it.  The resulting C
language<a id="id2879653" class="indexterm"/> evolved
from B beginning in 1971; in 1973 Thompson and Ritchie finally
succeeded in rewriting Unix in their new language.  This was quite an
audacious move; at the time, system programming was done in assembler
in order to extract maximum performance from the hardware, and the
very concept of a portable operating system was barely a gleam in
anyone's eye. As late as 1979, Ritchie<a id="id2879669" class="indexterm"/> could write: &#8220;It seems certain that
much of the success of Unix follows from the readability,
modifiability, and portability of its software that in turn follows
from its expression in high-level languages&#8221;, in the knowledge
that this was a point that still needed making.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/kd14.jpg"/><div class="caption"><p>Ken (seated) and Dennis (standing) at a PDP-11 in 1972.</p></div></div><p>A 1974 paper in <i>Communications of the ACM</i>
[<a href="apb.html#Ritchie-Thompson" title="[Ritchie-Thompson]">Ritchie-Thompson</a>] gave Unix its first public
exposure.  In that paper, its authors described the unprecedentedly
simple design of Unix, and reported over 600 Unix installations. All
were on machines underpowered even by the standards of that day, but
(as Ritchie and Thompson wrote) &#8220;constraint has encouraged not
only economy, but also a certain elegance of design&#8221;.</p><p>After the CACM paper, research labs and universities all over
the world clamored for the chance to try out Unix themselves.  Under a
1958 consent decree in settlement of an antitrust case, AT&amp;T
<a id="id2879792" class="indexterm"/>(the parent organization of Bell Labs) had
been forbidden from entering the computer business.  Unix could not,
therefore, be turned into a product; indeed, under the terms of
the consent decree, Bell Labs was required to license its nontelephone
technology to anyone who asked.  Ken
Thompson<a id="id2879808" class="indexterm"/>
quietly began answering requests by shipping out tapes and disk packs
&#8212; each, according to legend, with a note signed &#8220;love,
ken&#8221;.</p><p>This was years before personal computers. Not only was the
hardware needed to run Unix too expensive to be within an individual's
reach, but nobody imagined that would change in the foreseeable
future.  So Unix machines were only available by the grace of big
organizations with big budgets: corporations, universities,
government agencies. But use of these minicomputers was less regulated
than the even-bigger mainframes, and Unix development rapidly took on
a countercultural air.  It was the early 1970s; the pioneering Unix
programmers were shaggy hippies and hippie-wannabes.  They delighted
in playing with an operating system that not only offered them
fascinating challenges at the leading edge of computer science, but also
subverted all the technical assumptions and business practices that
went with Big Computing.  Card punches, COBOL, business suits, and
batch IBM<a id="id2879768" class="indexterm"/> mainframes were
the despised old wave; Unix
hackers<a id="id2879850" class="indexterm"/> reveled in
the sense that they were simultaneously building the future and
flipping a finger at the system.</p><p>The excitement of those days is captured in this quote from
Douglas Comer: &#8220;Many universities contributed to UNIX. At the
University of Toronto, the department acquired a 200-dot-per-inch
printer/plotter and built software that used the printer to simulate a
phototypesetter. At Yale University, students and computer scientists
modified the UNIX shell. At Purdue University, the Electrical
Engineering Department made major improvements in performance,
producing a version of UNIX that supported a larger number of
users. Purdue also developed one of the first UNIX computer
networks. At the University of California at Berkeley, students
developed a new shell and dozens of smaller utilities. By the late
1970s, when Bell Labs released Version 7 UNIX, it was clear that the
system solved the computing problems of many departments, and that it
incorporated many of the ideas that had arisen in universities. The
end result was a strengthened system. A tide of ideas had started a
new cycle, flowing from academia to an industrial laboratory, back to
academia, and finally moving on to a growing number of commercial
sites&#8221; [<a href="apb.html#Comer" title="[Comer]">Comer</a>].</p><p>The first Unix of which it can be said that essentially all of
it would be recognizable to a modern Unix programmer was the Version 7
release in 1979.<sup>[<a id="id2879903" href="#ftn.id2879903">15</a>]</sup>
The first Unix user group had formed the previous year. By this time
Unix was in use for operations support all through the Bell System
[<a href="apb.html#Hauben" title="[Hauben]">Hauben</a>], and had spread to universities as far away
as Australia, where John Lions's 1976 notes [<a href="apb.html#Lions" title="[Lions]">Lions</a>] on
the Version 6 source code became the first serious documentation of
the Unix kernel internals.  Many senior Unix hackers still treasure a

year.  By 1980 an obscure software company in Seattle was also getting
into the Unix game, shipping a port of the
AT&amp;T<a id="id2879988" class="indexterm"/> version for microcomputers called XENIX.
But Microsoft's<a id="id2880000" class="indexterm"/>

campus of the University of California emerged early as the single
most important academic hot-spot in Unix development.  Unix research
had begun there in 1974, and was given a substantial impetus when Ken
Thompson<a id="id2880035" class="indexterm"/> taught
at the University during a 1975-76 sabbatical. The first BSD
release<a id="id2880045" class="indexterm"/> had been in
1977 from a lab run by a then-unknown grad student named Bill
Joy<a id="id2880055" class="indexterm"/>.  By 1980
Berkeley was the hub of a sub-network of universities actively
contributing to their variant of Unix.  Ideas and code from Berkeley
Unix (including the
vi(1)
editor)<a id="id2880074" class="indexterm"/> were feeding back
from Berkeley to Bell Labs.</p><p>Then, in 1980, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
needed a team to implement its brand-new
TCP/IP<a id="id2880090" class="indexterm"/> protocol stack
on the VAX under Unix.  The PDP-10s<a id="id2880099" class="indexterm"/> that
powered the ARPANET at that time were aging, and indications that DEC
might be forced to cancel the 10 in order to support the VAX were
already in the air.  DARPA considered contracting DEC to implement
TCP/IP<a id="id2880114" class="indexterm"/>, but rejected
that idea because they were concerned that DEC might not be responsive
to requests for changes in their proprietary
VAX/VMS<a id="id2880125" class="indexterm"/>
operating system [<a href="apb.html#Libes-Ressler" title="[Libes-Ressler]">Libes-Ressler</a>]. Instead, DARPA
chose Berkeley Unix as a platform &#8212; explicitly because its
source code was available and unencumbered [<a href="apb.html#Leonard" title="[Leonard]">Leonard</a>].</p><p>Berkeley's<a id="id2880151" class="indexterm"/>
Computer Science Research Group was in the right place at the right
time with the strongest development tools; the result became arguably
the most critical turning point in Unix's history since its
invention.</p><p>Until the TCP/IP<a id="id2880167" class="indexterm"/>
implementation was released with Berkeley<a id="id2880176" class="indexterm"/> 4.2 in 1983, Unix
had had only the weakest networking support.  Early experiments with
Ethernet were unsatisfactory.  An ugly but serviceable facility called
UUCP (Unix to Unix Copy Program) had been developed at Bell Labs for
distributing software over conventional telephone lines via modem.<sup>[<a id="id2880193" href="#ftn.id2880193">16</a>]</sup>  UUCP could forward Unix mail
between widely separated machines, and (after Usenet was invented in
1981) supported
Usenet<a id="id2880205" class="indexterm"/>, a distributed
bulletin-board facility that allowed users to broadcast text messages
to anywhere that had phone lines and Unix systems.</p><p>Still, the few Unix users aware of the bright lights of the
ARPANET felt like they were stuck in a backwater.  No FTP, no telnet,
only the most restricted remote job execution, and painfully slow
links.  Before TCP/IP<a id="id2880224" class="indexterm"/>,
the Internet and Unix cultures did not mix.  Dennis
Ritchie's<a id="id2880234" class="indexterm"/>
vision of computers as a way to &#8220;encourage close
communication&#8221; was one of collegial communities clustered
around individual timesharing machines or in the same computing
center; it didn't extend to the continent-wide distributed
&#8216;network nation&#8217; that ARPA users had started to form in
the mid-1970s.  Early ARPANETters, for their part, considered Unix a
crude makeshift limping along on risibly weak hardware.</p><p>After TCP/IP<a id="id2880258" class="indexterm"/>,
everything changed. The ARPANET and Unix cultures began to merge at
the edges, a development that would eventually save both from
destruction.  But there would be hell to pay first as the result of
two unrelated disasters; the rise of
Microsoft<a id="id2880271" class="indexterm"/> and the
AT&amp;T<a id="id2880279" class="indexterm"/> divestiture.</p><a id="id2880292" class="indexterm"/><p><a id="ms_history"/>In 1981, Microsoft made its historic deal with
IBM<a id="id2880310" class="indexterm"/> over the new IBM
PC. Bill Gates bought QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), a clone
of CP/M that its programmer Tim Paterson had thrown together in six
weeks, from Paterson's employer Seattle Computer Products. Gates,
concealing the IBM deal from Paterson and SCP, bought the rights for
$50,000.  He then talked IBM into allowing Microsoft to market MS-DOS
separately from the PC hardware.  Over the next decade, leveraging
code he didn't write made Bill Gates a multibillionaire, and
business tactics even sharper than the original deal gained Microsoft
a monopoly lock on desktop computing.  XENIX as a product was rapidly
deep-sixed, and eventually sold to SCO.</p><p><a id="ms_effects"/>It was not apparent at the time how successful
(or how destructive)
Microsoft<a id="id2880339" class="indexterm"/> was going
to be.  Since the IBM PC-1 didn't have the hardware capacity to run
Unix, Unix people barely noticed it at all (though, ironically enough,
DOS 2.0 eclipsed CP/M largely because Microsoft's co-founder Paul Allen
merged in Unix features including subdirectories and
pipes<a id="id2880352" class="indexterm"/>).  There were
things that seemed much more interesting going on &#8212; like the
1982 launching of Sun Microsystems<a id="id2880363" class="indexterm"/>.</p><p>Sun Microsystems<a id="id2880376" class="indexterm"/> founders Bill
Joy<a id="id2880384" class="indexterm"/>, Andreas
Bechtolsheim, and Vinod Khosla set out to build a dream Unix machine
with built-in networking capability.  They combined hardware designed
at Stanford with the Unix developed at Berkeley to produce a smashing
success, and founded the workstation industry.  At the time, nobody
much minded watching source-code access to one branch of the Unix tree
gradually dry up as Sun began to behave less like a freewheeling
startup and more like a conventional
firm. Berkeley<a id="id2880401" class="indexterm"/> was
still distributing BSD<a id="id2880410" class="indexterm"/> with source code. Officially, System
III<a id="id2880419" class="indexterm"/> source
licenses cost $40,000 each; but Bell Labs was turning a blind eye to
the number of bootleg Bell Labs Unix tapes in circulation, the
universities were still swapping code with Bell Labs, and it looked
like Sun's<a id="id2880431" class="indexterm"/>
commercialization of Unix might just be the best thing to happen to it
yet.</p><p>1982 was also the year that C<a id="id2880446" class="indexterm"/> first showed signs of establishing
itself outside the Unix world as the systems-programming language of
choice.  It would only take about five years for
C<a id="id2880457" class="indexterm"/> to drive machine
assemblers almost completely out of use.  By the early 1990s C and
C++<a id="id2880467" class="indexterm"/> would dominate not
only systems but application programming; by the late 1990s all other
conventional compiled languages would be effectively obsolete.</p><p>When DEC canceled development on the
PDP-10's<a id="id2880483" class="indexterm"/> successor
machine (Jupiter) in 1983, VAXes running Unix began to take over as
the dominant Internet machines, a position they would hold until being
displaced by Sun workstations<a id="id2880497" class="indexterm"/>.  By 1985, about 25% of all VAXes
would be running Unix despite DEC's stiff opposition.  But the
longest-term effect of the Jupiter cancellation was a less obvious
one; the death of the MIT AI Lab's PDP-10-centered hacker culture
motivated a programmer named Richard
Stallman<a id="id2880511" class="indexterm"/>
to begin writing GNU<a id="id2880520" class="indexterm"/>, a complete free clone of Unix.</p><p>By 1983 there were no fewer than six Unix-workalike
operating systems for the IBM-PC: uNETix, Venix, Coherent, QNX, Idris,
and the port hosted on the Sritek PC daughtercard.  There was still no
port of Unix in either the
System V<a id="id2880537" class="indexterm"/> or
BSD<a id="id2880546" class="indexterm"/> versions;
both groups considered the 8086 microprocessor woefully
underpowered and wouldn't go near it.  None of the Unix-workalikes
were significant as commercial successes, but they indicated a
significant demand for Unix on cheap hardware that the major vendors
were not supplying.  No individual could afford to meet it, either,
not with the $40,000 price-tag on a source-code license.</p><p>Sun<a id="id2880566" class="indexterm"/>
was already a success (with imitators!) when, in 1983, the
U.S. Department of Justice won its second antitrust case against
AT&amp;T<a id="id2880576" class="indexterm"/> and broke
up the Bell System.  This relieved AT&amp;T from the 1958 consent
decree that had prevented them from turning Unix into a product.
AT&amp;T promptly rushed to commercialize Unix System V&#8212;a move
that nearly killed Unix.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>So true.

nucleus of a healthy Unix industry &#8212; one that, using inexpensive

of Unix would destroy the free exchanges of source code that had nurtured
so much of the system's early vitality.  Knowing no other model than
secrecy for collecting profits from software and no other model than
centralized control for developing a commercial product, AT&amp;T
clamped down hard on source-code distribution.  Bootleg Unix tapes became
far less interesting in the knowledge that the threat of lawsuit might
come with them.  Contributions from universities began to dry up.</p><p>To make matters worse, the big new players in the Unix market
promptly committed major strategic blunders.  One was to seek
advantage by product differentiation &#8212; a tactic which resulted
in the interfaces of different Unixes diverging.  This threw away
cross-platform compatibility and fragmented the Unix market.</p><p>The other, subtler error was to behave as if personal computers

irrelevant to Unix's prospects.  Sun

AT&amp;T<a id="id2885370" class="indexterm"/>, fixated on
minicomputers and mainframes, tried several different strategies to
become a major player in computers, and badly botched all of them.  A
dozen small companies formed to support Unix on PCs; all were
underfunded, focused on selling to developers and engineers, and never
aimed at the business and home market that Microsoft was
targeting.</p><p>In fact, for years after divestiture the Unix community was
preoccupied with the first phase of the Unix
wars<a id="id2885392" class="indexterm"/> &#8212; an
internal dispute, the rivalry between System
V Unix<a id="id2885401" class="indexterm"/> and BSD
Unix<a id="id2885409" class="indexterm"/>. The dispute
had several levels, some technical (sockets vs. streams,
BSD<a id="id2885419" class="indexterm"/> tty vs. System V
termio) and some cultural.  The divide was roughly between
longhairs and shorthairs; programmers and technical people tended to
line up with Berkeley and BSD<a id="id2885430" class="indexterm"/>, more business-oriented types with AT&amp;T
and System V<a id="id2885440" class="indexterm"/>.
The longhairs, repeating a theme from Unix's early days ten years
before, liked to see themselves as rebels against a corporate empire;
one of the small companies put out a poster showing an X-wing-like
space fighter marked &#8220;BSD&#8221; speeding away from a huge
AT&amp;T &#8216;death star&#8217; logo left broken and in flames. Thus
we fiddled while Rome burned.</p><p>But something else happened in the year of the
AT&amp;T divestiture that would have more long-term importance for
Unix.  A programmer/linguist named Larry Wall quietly invented the
patch(1)
utility.  The <i>patch</i> program, a simple tool
that applies changebars generated by
diff(1)
to a base file, meant that Unix developers could cooperate by passing
around patch sets &#8212; incremental changes to code &#8212; rather
than entire code files.  This was important not only because patches
are less bulky than full files, but because patches would often apply
cleanly even if much of the base file had changed since the
patch-sender fetched his copy.  With this tool, streams of development
on a common source-code base could diverge, run in parallel, and
re-converge.  The <i>patch</i> program did more
than any other single tool to enable collaborative development over
the Internet &#8212; a method that would revitalize Unix after
1990.</p><p>In 1985 Intel shipped the first 386 chip, capable of addressing 4
gigabytes of memory with a flat address space.  The clumsy segment
addressing of the 8086 and 286 became immediately obsolete.  This was
big news, because it meant that for the first time, a microprocessor in
the dominant Intel family had the capability to run Unix without
painful compromises.  The handwriting was on the wall for
Sun<a id="id2885525" class="indexterm"/> and the
other workstation makers.  They failed to see it.</p><p>1985 was also the year that Richard
Stallman<a id="id2885540" class="indexterm"/>
issued the GNU manifesto [<a href="apb.html#Stallman" title="[Stallman]">Stallman</a>] and launched the
Free Software Foundation<a id="id2885555" class="indexterm"/>.  Very few people took him or his
GNU<a id="id2885564" class="indexterm"/> project
seriously, a judgment that turned out to be seriously mistaken.  In
an unrelated development of the same year, the originators of the X
window system released it as source code without royalties,
restrictions, or license code.  As a direct result of this decision,
it became a safe neutral area for collaboration between Unix vendors,
and defeated proprietary contenders to become Unix's graphics
engine.</p><p>Serious standardization efforts aimed at reconciling the System
V<a id="id2885585" class="indexterm"/> and
Berkeley<a id="id2885594" class="indexterm"/> APIs also
began in 1983 with the /usr/group standard. This was followed in 1985
by the POSIX<a id="id2885604" class="indexterm"/> standards, an
effort backed by the IEEE.  These described the intersection set of
the BSD<a id="id2885614" class="indexterm"/> and SVR3
(System V Release 3)<a id="id2885622" class="indexterm"/> calls, with the superior Berkeley signal
handling and job control but with SVR3 terminal control.  All later
Unix standards would incorporate POSIX at their core, and later Unixes
would adhere to it closely. The only major addition to the modern Unix
kernel API to come afterwards was BSD sockets.</p><p>In 1986 Larry Wall<a id="id2885641" class="indexterm"/>, previously the inventor of
patch(1),
began work on Perl<a id="id2885658" class="indexterm"/>, which would become the first and most
widely used of the open-source scripting languages. In early 1987 the
first version of the GNU C compiler <a id="id2885670" class="indexterm"/><a id="id2885676" class="indexterm"/> appeared, and by the end of 1987 the
core of the GNU toolset was falling into place<a id="id2885687" class="indexterm"/>: editor, compiler, debugger, and
other basic development tools.  Meanwhile, the X windowing
system<a id="id2885697" class="indexterm"/> was
beginning to show up on relatively inexpensive workstations. Together,
these would provide the armature for the open-source Unix developments
of the 1990s.</p><p>1986 was also the year that PC technology broke free of IBM's
grip.  IBM<a id="id2885713" class="indexterm"/>, still trying
to preserve a price-vs.-power curve across its product line that would
favor its high-margin mainframe business, rejected the 386 for most of
its new line of PS/2 computers in favor of the weaker 286.  The PS/2
series, designed around a proprietary bus architecture to lock out
clonemakers, became a colossally expensive failure.<sup>[<a id="id2885728" href="#ftn.id2885728">17</a>]</sup>  Compaq, the most aggressive of the
clonemakers, trumped IBM's move by releasing the first 386 machine.
Even with a clock speed of a mere 16 MHz, the 386 made a tolerable Unix
machine.  It was the first PC of which that could be said.</p><p>It was beginning to be possible to imagine that
Stallman's<a id="id2885750" class="indexterm"/> GNU project<a id="id2885759" class="indexterm"/> might mate with 386 machines to produce
Unix workstations almost an order of magnitude less costly than anyone
was offering.  Curiously, no one seems to have actually got this far
in their thinking.  Most Unix programmers, coming from the
minicomputer and workstation worlds, continued to disdain cheap 80x86
machines in favor of more elegant 68000-based designs.  And, though a
lot of programmers contributed to the GNU
project<a id="id2885776" class="indexterm"/>, among
Unix people it tended to be considered a quixotic gesture that was
unlikely to have near-term practical consequences.</p><p>The Unix community had never lost its rebel streak.  But in
retrospect, we were nearly as blind to the future bearing down on us
as IBM<a id="id2885793" class="indexterm"/> or
AT&amp;T<a id="id2885801" class="indexterm"/>.  Not even
Richard Stallman<a id="id2885810" class="indexterm"/>, who had declared a moral crusade against
proprietary software a few years before, really understood how badly
the productization of Unix had damaged the community around it; his
concerns were with more abstract and long-term issues.  The rest of us
kept hoping that some clever variation on the corporate formula would
solve the problems of fragmentation, wretched marketing, and strategic
drift, and redeem Unix's pre-divestiture
promise<a id="id2885827" class="indexterm"/>.  But worse was still to
come.</p><p>1988 was the year Ken Olsen (CEO of DEC) famously described Unix
as &#8220;snake oil&#8221;.  DEC had been shipping its own variant of
Unix on PDP-11s<a id="id2885849" class="indexterm"/> since
1982, but really wanted the business to go to its proprietary
VMS<a id="id2885862" class="indexterm"/>
operating system.  DEC and the minicomputer industry were in deep
trouble, swamped by waves of powerful low-cost machines coming out of
Sun Microsystems<a id="id2885873" class="indexterm"/> and the rest of the workstation
vendors. Most of those workstations ran Unix.</p><p>But the Unix industry's own problems were growing more severe.
In 1988 AT&amp;T took a 20% stake in Sun Microsystems.  These two
companies, the leaders in the Unix market, were beginning to wake up
to the threat posed by PCs, IBM, and Microsoft, and to realize that
the preceding five years of bloodletting had gained them little.  The
AT&amp;T/Sun alliance and the development of technical standards around
POSIX<a id="id2885895" class="indexterm"/> eventually healed
the breach between the System V<a id="id2885904" class="indexterm"/> and BSD Unix<a id="id2885912" class="indexterm"/> lines.  But the second phase of the Unix
wars<a id="id2885921" class="indexterm"/> began when the
second-tier vendors (IBM<a id="id2885930" class="indexterm"/>,
DEC, Hewlett-Packard, and others) formed the Open Software Foundation
and lined up against the AT&amp;T/Sun axis (represented by Unix
International).  More rounds of Unix fighting Unix ensued.</p><p>Meanwhile,
Microsoft<a id="id2885947" class="indexterm"/> was
making billions in the home and small-business markets that the
warring Unix factions had never found the will to address. The 1990
release of Windows 3.0 &#8212; the first successful graphical
operating system from Redmond &#8212; cemented Microsoft's dominance,
and created the conditions that would allow them to flatten and
monopolize the market for desktop applications in the 1990s.</p><p>The years from 1989 to 1993 were the darkest in Unix's history.
It appeared then that all the Unix community's dreams had failed.
Internecine warfare had reduced the proprietary Unix industry to a
squabbling shambles that never summoned either the determination or
the capability to challenge Microsoft.  The elegant Motorola chips
favored by most Unix programmers had lost out to Intel's ugly but
inexpensive processors.  The GNU project<a id="id2885975" class="indexterm"/> failed to produce the free Unix kernel
it had been promising since 1985, and after years of excuses
its credibility was beginning to wear thin.  PC technology was being
relentlessly corporatized.  The pioneering Unix
hackers<a id="id2885987" class="indexterm"/> of the 1970s
were hitting middle age and slowing down.  Hardware was getting
cheaper, but Unix was still too expensive.  We were belatedly becoming
aware that the old monopoly of
IBM<a id="id2885999" class="indexterm"/> had yielded to a
newer monopoly of
Microsoft<a id="id2886008" class="indexterm"/>, and
Microsoft's mal-engineered software was rising around us like a tide
of sewage.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2886020"/>Blows against the Empire: 1991-1995</h3></div></div><p>The first glimmer of light in the darkness was the 1990 effort
by William Jolitz to port BSD<a id="id2886031" class="indexterm"/> onto a 386 box, publicized by a series of
magazine articles beginning in 1991.  The 386BSD port was possible because,
partly influenced by Stallman<a id="id2886042" class="indexterm"/>,
Berkeley<a id="id2886051" class="indexterm"/> hacker
Keith Bostic<a id="id2886059" class="indexterm"/>
had begun an effort to clean AT&amp;T proprietary code out of the BSD
sources in 1988.  But the 386BSD project took a severe blow when, near
the end of 1991, Jolitz walked away from it and destroyed his own
work.  There are conflicting explanations, but a common thread in all
is that Jolitz wanted his code to be released as unencumbered source
and was upset when the corporate sponsors of the project opted for a
more proprietary licensing model.</p><p>In August 1991 Linus Torvalds<a id="id2886081" class="indexterm"/>, then an unknown university student from
Finland, announced the Linux<a id="id2886090" class="indexterm"/> project.  Torvalds is on record that one
of his main motivations was the high cost of Sun's<a id="id2886101" class="indexterm"/> Unix at his university.  Torvalds
has also said that he would have joined the BSD<a id="id2886111" class="indexterm"/> effort had he known of it, rather than
founding his own.  But 386BSD was not shipped until early 1992, some
months after the first Linux release.</p><p>The importance of both these projects became clear only in
retrospect. At the time, they attracted little notice even within the
Internet hacker culture &#8212; let alone in the wider Unix community,
which was still fixated on more capable machines than PCs, and on
trying to reconcile the special properties of Unix with the
conventional proprietary model of a software business.</p><p>It would take another two years and the great Internet explosion
of 1993&#8211;1994 before the true importance of
Linux<a id="id2886139" class="indexterm"/> and the
open-source<a id="id2886151" class="indexterm"/>
BSD<a id="id2886159" class="indexterm"/> distributions
became evident to the rest of the Unix world.  Unfortunately for the
BSDers, an AT&amp;T<a id="id2886169" class="indexterm"/>
lawsuit against BSDI (the startup company that had backed the Jolitz
port) consumed much of that time and motivated some key
Berkeley<a id="id2886180" class="indexterm"/> developers
to switch to Linux.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Code copying and theft of trade secrets was alleged. The actual
infringing code was not identified for nearly two years. The lawsuit
could have dragged on for much longer but for the fact that Novell
bought USL from AT&amp;T and sought a settlement. In the end, three files
were removed from the 18,000 that made up the distribution, and a
number of minor changes were made to other files. In addition, the
University agreed to add USL copyrights to about 70 files, with the
stipulation that those files continued to be freely redistributed.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

working Unix from proprietary control, but its effects on BSD itself
were dire.  Matters were not helped when, in 1992&#8211;1994, the
Computer Science Research Group at
Berkeley<a id="id2886242" class="indexterm"/> shut
down<a id="id2886251" class="indexterm"/>; afterwards,
factional warfare within the BSD community split it into
three competing development efforts.  As a result, the BSD lineage
lagged behind Linux<a id="id2886262" class="indexterm"/> at a crucial time and lost to it
the lead position in the Unix community.</p><p>The Linux<a id="id2886279" class="indexterm"/> and BSD<a id="id2886288" class="indexterm"/> development efforts were native to the
Internet in a way previous Unixes had not been.  They relied on
distributed development and Larry Wall's
patch(1)
tool, and recruited developers via email and through
Usenet<a id="id2886308" class="indexterm"/> newsgroups.
Accordingly, they got a tremendous boost when Internet Service
Provider businesses began to proliferate in 1993, enabled by changes
in telecomm technology and the privatization of the Internet backbone
that are outside the scope of this history.  The demand for cheap
Internet was created by something else: the 1991 invention of
the World Wide Web.  The Web was the &#8220;killer app&#8221; of the
Internet, the graphical user interface technology that made it
irresistible to a huge population of nontechnical end users.</p><p>The mass-marketing of the Internet both increased the pool of
potential developers and lowered the transaction costs of distributed
development.  The results were reflected in efforts like XFree86,
which used the Internet-centric model to build a more effective
development organization than that of the official X
Consortium<a id="id2886337" class="indexterm"/>.  The
first XFree86 in 1992 gave Linux<a id="id2886349" class="indexterm"/> and the BSDs<a id="id2886357" class="indexterm"/> the graphical-user-interface engine they
had been missing.  Over the next decade XFree86 would lead in X
development, and an increasing portion of the X Consortium's activity
would come to consist of funneling innovations originated in the
XFree86 community back to the Consortium's industrial sponsors.</p><p>By late 1993, Linux<a id="id2886376" class="indexterm"/> had both Internet capability and
X<a id="id2886385" class="indexterm"/>. The entire
GNU toolkit had been hosted on it from the beginning, providing
high-quality development tools<a id="id2886395" class="indexterm"/>.  Beyond GNU tools,
Linux<a id="id2886404" class="indexterm"/> acted as a basin of attraction,
collecting and concentrating twenty years of open-source software that
had previously been scattered across a dozen different proprietary
Unix platforms.  Though the Linux kernel was still officially in beta
(at 0.99 level), it was remarkably crash-free.  The breadth and
quality of the software in Linux<a id="id2886422" class="indexterm"/> distributions was already that of a
production-ready operating system.</p><p>A few of the more flexible-minded among old-school Unix
developers began to notice that the long-awaited dream of a cheap Unix
system for everybody had snuck up on them from an unexpected direction.
It didn't come from
AT&amp;T<a id="id2886440" class="indexterm"/> or
Sun<a id="id2886448" class="indexterm"/> or any
of the traditional vendors. Nor did it rise out of an organized effort
in academia.  It was a bricolage that bubbled up out of the Internet
by what seemed like spontaneous generation, appropriating and
recombining elements of the Unix tradition in surprising ways.</p><p>Elsewhere, corporate maneuvering continued.
AT&amp;T<a id="id2886467" class="indexterm"/> divested
its interest in Sun in 1992; then sold its Unix Systems Laboratories
to Novell in 1993; Novell handed off the Unix trademark to the X/Open
standards group in 1994; AT&amp;T and Novell joined OSF in 1994,
finally ending the Unix wars<a id="id2886479" class="indexterm"/>.  In 1995 SCO bought UnixWare (and the
rights to the original Unix sources) from Novell.  In 1996, X/Open and
OSF merged, creating one big Unix standards group.</p><p>But the conventional Unix vendors and the wreckage of their wars
came to seem steadily less and less relevant.  The action and energy
in the Unix community were shifting to Linux<a id="id2886498" class="indexterm"/> and BSD<a id="id2886510" class="indexterm"/> and the open-source<a id="id2886518" class="indexterm"/> developers.  By the time
IBM<a id="id2886527" class="indexterm"/>, Intel, and SCO
announced the Monterey project in 1998 &#8212; a last-gasp attempt to
merge One Big System out of all the proprietary Unixes left standing
&#8212; developers and the trade press reacted with amusement, and the
project was abruptly canceled in 2001 after three years of going
nowhere.</p><p>The industry transition could not be said to have completed
until 2000, when SCO sold UnixWare and the original Unix source-code
base to Caldera &#8212; a Linux distributor. But after 1995, the story
of Unix became the story of the open-source movement.  There's another
side to that story; to tell it, we'll need to return to 1961 and the 
origins of the Internet hacker culture.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2881371" href="#id2881371">13</a>] </sup>Ken Thompson
