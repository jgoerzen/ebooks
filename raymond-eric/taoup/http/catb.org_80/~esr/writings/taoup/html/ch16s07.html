more than one. Under U.S. federal law, the authors of a work hold
copyright even if there is no copyright notice.</p><p>Who counts as an author under copyright law can be complicated,
especially for software that has been worked on by many hands.  This
is why licenses are important.  They can authorize uses of code in
ways that would be otherwise impermissible under copyright law and,
drafted appropriately, can protect users from arbitrary actions by the
copyright holders.</p><p>In the proprietary software world, the license terms are designed to
protect the copyright. They're a way of granting a few rights to
users while reserving as much legal territory as possible for the
owner (the copyright holder). The copyright holder is very
important, and the license logic so restrictive that the exact
technicalities of the license terms are usually unimportant.</p><p>As will be seen below, the copyright holder typically uses the
copyright to protect the license, which makes the code freely
available under terms he intends to perpetuate
indefinitely. Otherwise, only a few rights are reserved and most
choices pass to the user. In particular, the copyright holder cannot
change the terms on a copy you already have. Therefore, in open-source
software the copyright holder is almost irrelevant &#8212; but the
license terms are very important.</p><p>Normally the copyright holder of a project is the current
project leader or sponsoring organization. Transfer of the project to
a new leader is often signaled by changing the copyright holder.
However, this is not a hard and fast rule; many open-source projects
have multiple copyright holders, and there is no instance on record of
this leading to legal problems. Some projects choose to assign
copyright to the Free Software Foundation, on the theory that it has
an interest in defending open source and lawyers available to do
it.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2991059"/>What Qualifies as Open Source</h3></div></div><p>For licensing purposes, we can distinguish several different
kinds of rights that a license may convey. There are rights to copy and
redistribute, rights to use, rights to modify for personal use, and
rights to redistribute modified copies. A license may restrict or
attach conditions to any of these rights.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html" target="_top">Open Source
Definition</a> is the result of a great deal of thought about what
makes software &#8220;open source&#8221; or (in older terminology)
&#8220;free&#8221;.  It is widely accepted in the open-source
community as an articulation of the social contract among open-source
developers. Its constraints on licensing impose the following
requirements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>An unlimited right to copy be granted.</p></li><li><p>An unlimited right to redistribute in unmodified form be granted.</p></li><li><p>An unlimited right to modify for personal use be granted.</p></li></ul></div><p>The guidelines prohibit restrictions on redistribution of
modified binaries; this meets the needs of software distributors, who
need to be able to ship working code without encumbrance. It allows
authors to require that modified sources be redistributed as pristine
sources plus patches, thus establishing the author's intentions and an
&#8220;audit trail&#8221; of any changes by others.</p><p>The OSD is the legal definition of the &#8220;OSI Certified Open
Source&#8221; certification mark, and as good a definition of
&#8220;free software&#8221; as anyone has ever come up with. All of
the standard licenses (MIT,
BSD<a id="id2991138" class="indexterm"/>, Artistic, GPL/LGPL,
and MPL) meet it (though some, like GPL, have other restrictions which
you should understand before choosing it).</p><p>Note that licenses that allow only noncommercial use do not
qualify as open-source licenses, even if they are based on GPL or some
other standard license. Such licenses discriminate against particular
occupations, persons, and groups, a practice which the OSD's Clause 5
explicitly forbids.</p><p>Clause 5 was written after years of painful experience.
No-commercial-use licenses turn out to have the problem that there is
no bright-line legal test for what sort of redistribution qualifies as
&#8216;commercial&#8217;.  Selling the software as a product
qualifies, certainly.  But what if it were distributed at a nominal
price of zero in conjunction with other software or data, and a price
is charged for the whole collection?  Would it make a difference
whether the software were essential to the function of the whole
collection?</p><p>Nobody knows.  The very fact that no-commercial-use licenses
create uncertainty about a redistributor's legal exposure is a serious
strike against them. One of the objectives of the OSD is to ensure
that people in the distribution chain of OSD-conforming software do
not need to consult with intellectual-property lawyers
to know what their rights are.  OSD forbids complicated restrictions 
against persons, groups, and occupations partly so that people
dealing with collections of software will not face a combinatorial
explosion of slightly differing (and perhaps conflicting) restrictions
on what they can do with it.</p><p>This concern is not hypothetical, either.  One important part of
the open-source distribution chain is CD-ROM distributors who
aggregate it in useful collections ranging from simple anthology
CDs up to bootable operating systems.  Restrictions that would make life
prohibitively complicated for CD-ROM distributors, or others trying to
spread open-source software commercially, have to be forbidden.</p><p>On the other hand, the OSD has nothing to say about the laws of
your jurisdiction.  Some countries have laws against exporting certain
restricted technologies to named &#8216;rogue states&#8217;. The OSD
cannot negate those, it only says that licensors may not add
restrictions of their own.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2993547"/>Standard Open-Source Licenses</h3></div></div><p>Here are the standard open-source license terms you are likely

point of view, in <a href="opensourcechapter.html" title="Chapter 19. Open Source">Chapter 19</a>.  For the purposes of this chapter, the
only important distinction among them is whether they are infectious
or not.  A license is <i>infectious</i> if it requires
that any derivative work of the licensed software also be placed under
its terms.</p><p>Under these licenses, the only kind of open-source use you
should really worry about is actual incorporation of the
free-software code into a proprietary product (as opposed, say, to
merely using open-source development tools to make your product).
If you're prepared to include proper license acknowledgements and
pointers to the source code you're using in your product
documentation, even direct incorporation should be safe provided
the license is not infectious.</p><p>The GPL is both the most widely used and the most controversial
infectious license.  And it is clause 2(b), requiring
that any derivative work of a GPLed program itself be GPLed, that
causes the controversy. (Clause 3(b) requiring licensors to make
source available on physical media on demand used to cause some,
but the Internet explosion has made publishing source code archives
as required by 3(a) so cheap that nobody worries about the source-publication
requirement any more.)</p><p>Nobody is quite certain what the &#8220;contains or is derived
from&#8221; in clause 2(b) means, nor what kinds of use are protected
by the &#8220;mere aggregation&#8221; language a few paragraphs later.
Contentious issues include library linking and inclusion of
GPL-licensed header files. Part of the problem is that the U.S. copyright 
statutes do not define what derivation is; it has been left to the
courts to hammer out definitions in case law, and computer software is
an area in which this process (as of mid-2003) has barely begun.</p><p>At one end, the &#8220;mere aggregation&#8221; certainly makes
it safe to ship GPLed software on the same media with your proprietary
code, provided they do not link to or call each other.  They may even
be tools operating on the same file formats or on-disk structures;
that situation, under copyright law, would not make one a derivative
of the other.</p><p>At the other end, splicing GPLed code into your proprietary
code, or linking GPLed object code to yours, certainly does make your
code a derivative work and requires it to be GPLed.</p><p>It is generally believed that one program may execute a second
program as a subprocess without either program becoming thereby a
derivative work of the other.</p><p>The case that causes dispute is dynamic linking of shared
libraries.  The Free Software Foundation's<a id="id2993793" class="indexterm"/> position is that if a
program calls another program as a shared library, then that program
is a derivative work of the library.  Some programmers think this
claim is overreaching.  There are technical, legal, and political
arguments on both sides that we won't rehash here.  Since the Free
Software Foundation<a id="id2993808" class="indexterm"/> wrote and owns the license, it would
be prudent to behave as if the FSF's position is correct until a court
rules otherwise.</p><p>Some people think the 2(b) language is deliberately designed to
infect every part of any commercial program that uses even a snippet
of GPLed code; such people refer to it as the GPV, or &#8220;General
Public Virus&#8221;. Others think the &#8220;mere aggregation&#8221;
language covers everything short of mixing GPL and non-GPL code in the
same compilation or linkage unit.</p><p>This uncertainty has caused enough agitation in the open-source
community that the FSF had to develop the special, slightly more
relaxed &#8220;Library GPL&#8221; (which they have since renamed the
&#8220;Lesser GPL&#8221;) to reassure people they could continue to
use runtime libraries that came with the FSF's GNU compiler
collection.</p><p>You'll have to choose your own interpretation of clause 2(b);
most lawyers will not understand the technical issues involved, and there is no
case law. As a matter of empirical fact, the
FSF<a id="id2993847" class="indexterm"/>
has never (from its founding in 1984 to mid-2003, at least) sued
anyone under the GPL but it has enforced the GPL by threatening
lawsuit, in all known cases successfully.  And, as another
empirical fact, Netscape includes the source and object of a GPLed
program with the commercial distribution of its Netscape Navigator
browser.</p><p>The MPL and LGPL are infectious in a more limited way than GPL.
They explicitly allow linking with proprietary code without turning
that code into a derivative work, provided all traffic between the
GPLed and non-GPLed code goes through a library API or other
well-defined interface.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2993874"/>When You Need a Lawyer</h3></div></div><p>This section is directed to commercial developers considering
incorporating software that falls under one of these standard licenses
into closed-source products.</p><p>Having gone through all this legal verbiage, the expected thing
for us to do at this point is to utter a somber disclaimer to the
effect that we are not lawyers, and that if you have any
doubts about the legality of something you want to do with open-source
software, you should immediately consult a lawyer.</p><p>With all due respect to the legal profession, this would be
fearful nonsense. The language of these licenses is as clear as
legalese gets &#8212; they were written to be clear &#8212; and should
not be at all hard to understand if you read it carefully. The lawyers
and courts are actually more confused than you are. The law of
software rights is murky, and case law on open-source licenses is
(as of mid-2003) nonexistent; no one has ever been sued under
them.</p><p>This means a lawyer is unlikely to have a significantly better
insight than a careful lay reader. But lawyers are professionally
paranoid about anything they don't understand. So if you ask one, he
is rather likely to tell you that you shouldn't go anywhere near
open-source software, despite the fact that he probably doesn't
understand the technical aspects or the author's intentions anywhere
near as well as you do.</p><p>Finally, the people who put their work under open-source
licenses<a id="id2993926" class="indexterm"/> are
generally not mega-corporations attended by schools of lawyers looking
for blood in the water; they're individuals or volunteer groups who
mainly want to give their software away.  The few exceptions (that is,
large companies both issuing under open-source licenses and with
money to hire lawyers) have a stake in open source and don't want to
antagonize the developer community that produces it by stirring up
legal trouble.  Therefore, your odds of getting hauled into court on
an innocent technical violation are probably lower than your chances
of being struck by lightning in the next week.</p><p>This isn't to say you should treat these licenses as jokes. That
would be disrespectful of the creativity and sweat that went into the
software, and you wouldn't enjoy being the first litigation target of
an enraged author no matter how the lawsuit came out. But in the
absence of definitive case law, a visible good-faith effort to meet
the author's intentions is 99% of what you can do; the additional 1%
of protection you might (or might not) get by consulting a lawyer is
unlikely to make a difference.</p></div></div></body></html>
