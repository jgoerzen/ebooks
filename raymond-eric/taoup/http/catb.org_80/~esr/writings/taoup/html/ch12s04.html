usually bounded by the cost of I/O and &#8212; especially with 
programs that use the Internet &#8212; network transactions.  It's
therefore valuable to know how to design network protocols for
good performance.</p><p>The most important issue is avoiding protocol round trips as
much as possible.  Every protocol transaction that requires a
handshake turns any latency in the connection into a potentially
serious slowdown.  Avoiding such handshakes is not specifically a
Unix-tradition practice, but it's one that needs mention here because
so many protocol designs lose huge amounts of performance to
them.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>I cannot say enough about latency.  X11 went well beyond

requests) per second.  But round trips are hundreds or thousands of
times more expensive. Anytime you can get a client to do something
without having to contact the server, you have a tremendous
win.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

possible latency and ignore bandwidth costs until your profiling tells
you otherwise.  Bandwidth problems can be solved later in development
by tricks like compressing a protocol stream on the fly; but getting
rid of high latency baked into an existing design is much, much harder
(often, effectively impossible).</p><p>While this effect shows up most clearly in network protocol
design, throughput vs. latency tradeoffs are a much more general
phenomenon.  In writing applications, you will sometimes face a choice
between doing an expensive computation once in anticipation that it
will be used several times, or computing only when actually needed
(even if that means you will often recompute results).  In most cases
where you face a tradeoff like this, the right thing to do is bias
toward low latency.  That is, don't try to precompute expensive
operations unless you have a throughput requirement and know by actual
measurement that the throughput you are getting is too low.
Precomputation may seem efficient because it minimizes total use of
processor cycles, but processor cycles are cheap.  Unless you are
doing one of a handful of monstrously compute-intensive applications
like data mining, animation rendering, or the aforementioned bomb
simulations, it is usually better to opt for short startup times and
quick response.</p><p>In Unix's early days this advice might have been considered
heretical.  Processors were much slower and cost ratios were very
different then; also, the pattern of Unix use was tilted rather more
strongly toward server operations.  The point about the value of low
latency needs to be made partly because even newer Unix developers
sometimes inherit an old-time cultural prejudice toward optimizing for
throughput.  But times have changed.</p><p>Three general strategies for reducing latency are (a) batching
transactions that can share startup costs, (b) allowing transactions
to overlap, and (c) caching.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2961306"/>Batching Operations</h3></div></div><p>Graphics APIs are frequently written on the assumption that the
fixed setup cost for a physical screen update is large.  Consequently, the
write operations actually modify an internal buffer.  It is up to
the programmer to decide when enough of these updates have been batched 
and to issue the call that turns them into a physical screen update.
Picking the right spacing of physical updates can make a great deal
of difference to the feel of the graphics client.  Both the 
X server and the
curses(3)
library used by roguelike programs are organized in this way.</p><p>Persistent service daemons are a more Unix-specific example of
batching.  There are two reasons, one obvious and one subtle, to write
persistent daemons (as opposed to CLI servers that are started up
fresh for each session).  The obvious reason is to manage updates to a
shared resource.  The less obvious reason, which obtains even for daemons
that don't handle updates, is to amortize the cost of reading in the
daemon's database across multiple requests.  A perfect example of this
is the DNS service daemon
named(8),
which must sometimes handle thousands of requests per second, each one
of which may actually be blocking a user's Web page load.  One of the
tactics that makes
named(8)
fast is that it replaces parses of expensive on-disk text files
describing DNS zones with accesses to a cache held in memory.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2961372"/>Overlapping Operations</h3></div></div><p>In <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter 5. Textuality">Chapter 5</a> we
compared the POP3 and IMAP protocols for querying remote-mail
servers.  We noted that IMAP requests (unlike POP3 requests) are
tagged with a request identifier generated by the client; the server,
when it ships back a response, includes the tag of the request it
pertains to.</p><p>POP3 requests have to be processed in lockstep by both client
and server; the client sends a request, waits for the response to that
request, and only then can prepare and ship the next one.  IMAP
requests, on the other hand, are are tagged so they can be overlapped.
If an IMAP client knows that it wants to fetch multiple messages, it
can stream several fetch requests (each with a different tag) to the
IMAP server, without waiting for responses between them.  Responses,
each tagged, will come back when the server is ready; responses to
early requests may come in while the client is still shipping later
ones.</p><p>This strategy is general to more areas than network protocols.
If you want to cut latency, blocking or waiting on intermediate
results is deadly.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="binary_caches"/>Caching Operation Results</h3></div></div><p>Sometimes you can get the best of both worlds (low latency and
good throughput) by computing expensive results as needed and caching
them for later use.  Earlier we mentioned that
<i>named</i> reduces latency by batching; it
also reduces latency by caching the results of previous network
transactions with other DNS servers.</p><p>Caching has its own problems and tradeoffs, which are well
illustrated by one application: the use of binary caches to eliminate
parsing overhead associated with text database files.  Some variants
of Unix have used this technique to speed up access to their password
information (the usual motivation was to cut latency on logins at very
large sites).</p><p>To make this work, all code that looks at the binary cache has
to know that it should check the timestamps on both files and
regenerate the cache if the text master is newer.  Alternatively, all
changes to the textual master must be made through a wrapper that will
update the binary format.</p><p>While this approach can be made to work, it has all the
disadvantages that the SPOT<a id="id2961469" class="indexterm"/> rule would lead us to expect.  The
duplication of data means that it doesn't yield any economy of storage
&#8212; it's purely a speed
optimization<a id="id2961480" class="indexterm"/>.
But the real problem with it is that the code to ensure coherency
between cache and master is notoriously leaky and bug-prone.  Very
frequently updated cache files can lead to subtle race conditions
simply because of the 1-second resolution of timestamps.</p><p>Coherency can be guaranteed in simple cases.  One such is the
Python interpreter<a id="id2961499" class="indexterm"/>, which compiles and deposits on disk a
p-code file with extension <tt>.pyc</tt> when a
Python library file is first imported. On subsequent runs the cached
copy of the p-code is loaded unless the source has since changed (this
avoids reparsing the library source code on every run).  Emacs
Lisp uses a similar technique with <tt>.el</tt> and
<tt>.elc</tt> files.  This technique works because both
read and write accesses to the cache go through a single
program.</p><p>When the update pattern of the master is more complex, however,
the synchronization code tends to spring leaks. The Unix variants that
used this technique to speed up access to critical system databases
were infamous for spawning system-administrator horror stories that
reflected this.</p><p>In general, binary cache files are a brittle technique and
probably best avoided.  The work that went into implementing a
special-purpose hack to reduce latency in this one case would have
been better spent improving the application design so it doesn't have
a bottleneck there &#8212; or even on tuning to improve the speed of
the file system or the virtual-memory implementation.</p><p>When you think you are in a situation that demands caching, it
is wise to look one level deeper and ask why the caching is necessary.
It may well be no more difficult to solve that problem than it would
be to get all the edge cases in the caching software right.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch12s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="optimizationchapter.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="complexitychapter.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Nonlocality Considered Harmful </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 13. Complexity</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
