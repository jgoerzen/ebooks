very good at is acting as a front end for other development tools (we
discussed this from a philosophical angle in <a href="complexitychapter.html" title="Chapter 13. Complexity">Chapter 13</a>).  In fact, nearly every tool we've
discussed in this chapter can be driven from within an
Emacs editor session through front ends
that give them greater utility than they would have running
standalone.</p><p>To illustrate this, we'll walk you through the use of these
tools with Emacs in a typical
build/test/debug cycle. For details on them, see
Emacs's own on-line help system; this
section just gives you an overview, to motivate you to learn
more.</p><p>Read and learn &#8212; not just about
Emacs, but about the mental habit of
looking for synergies between programs, and creating them. Try to read
this section as instruction in philosophy, not just technique.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2989559"/>Emacs and <i>make</i></h3></div></div><p><i>Make</i>, for example, can be started
with the Emacs command <b>ESC-x
compile</b> followed by an Enter. This command will run
make(1)
in the current directory, capturing the output in an
Emacs buffer.</p><p>This by itself wouldn't be very useful. But
Emacs's <i>make</i>
mode knows about the error message format (featuring a source file and
line number) emitted by Unix C<a id="id2989610" class="indexterm"/> compilers and many other tools.</p><p>If anything run by <i>make</i> issues error
messages, the command <b>Ctl-X `</b> (control-X-backquote)
will try to parse them and take you to each error location in turn,
popping open a window on the appropriate file and taking the cursor to
the error line.<sup>[<a id="id2989640" href="#ftn.id2989640">138</a>]</sup></p><p>This makes it extremely easy to step through an entire build,
fixing any syntax that has been broken since the last compile.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2989677"/>Emacs and Runtime Debugging</h3></div></div><p>For catching runtime errors, Emacs
offers similar integration with your symbolic debugger &#8212; that
is, you can use an Emacs mode to set
breakpoints in your programs and examine their runtime state. You run
the debugger by sending it commands through an
Emacs window. Whenever the debugger stops
on a breakpoint, the message the debugger ships back about the source
location is parsed and used to pop up a window on the source around the
breakpoint.</p><p>Emacs's Grand Unified Debugger mode
supports all the major C debuggers:
gdb(1),
sdb(1),
dbx(1),
and
xdb(1). It
also supports Perl<a id="id2989734" class="indexterm"/> symbolic debugging using the perldb
module, and the standard debuggers for both
Java<a id="id2989744" class="indexterm"/> and
Python<a id="id2989753" class="indexterm"/>. Facilities built into Emacs Lisp
itself support interactive debugging of Emacs Lisp
code.</p><p>At time of writing (mid-2003) there is not yet support for
Tcl<a id="id2989768" class="indexterm"/> debugging
from within Emacs. The design of Tcl is
such that it seems unlikely to be added.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2989781"/>Emacs and Version Control</h3></div></div><p>Once you've corrected your program's syntax and fixed its
runtime bugs, you may want to save the changes into a
version-controlled archive. If you've only tried running
version-control tools from the shell, it's hard to blame you for
sloughing off this important step. Who wants to have to remember to
run checkout/checkin commands around every edit operation?</p><p>Fortunately, Emacs offers help here
too. Code built into Emacs implements a
simple-to-use front end for <i>SCCS</i>,
<i>RCS</i>, <i>CVS</i>, or
Subversion. The single command <b>Ctl-x v v</b> tries to
deduce the next logical version-control operation to do on the file
you are visiting. The operations this includes are registering a file,
checking out and locking it, and checking it back in (accepting a
change comment in a pop-up buffer).<sup>[<a id="id2989834" href="#ftn.id2989834">139</a>]</sup></p><p>Emacs also helps you view the change
history of version-controlled files, and helps you back out changes
you don't want. It makes it easy to apply version-control operations
to whole sets or project directory trees of files. In general, it does
a pretty good job of making version-control operations painless.</p><p>The implications of these features are larger than you might
guess before you've gotten used to it. You'll find, once you get used
to fast and easy version control, that it's extremely
liberating. Because you know you can always revert to a known-good
state, you'll find you feel more free to develop in a fluid and
exploratory way, trying lots of changes out to see their
effects.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2989869"/>Emacs and Profiling</h3></div></div><p>Surprise...this is perhaps the only phase of the development
cycle in which Emacs front-ending does
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> offer substantial help. Profiling is an
intrinsically batchy operation &#8212; instrument your program, run
it, view the statistics, speed-tune the code with an editor,
repeat. There isn't much room for Emacs
leverage in the profiling-specific parts of this cycle.</p><p>Nevertheless, there's a good tutorial reason for us to think
about Emacs and profiling. If you found
yourself analyzing a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of profiling reports, it
might pay you to write a mode in which a mouse click or keystroke on a
profile report line visited the source of the relevant function. This
actually would be fairly easy to do using the
Emacs &#8216;tags&#8217; code. In fact, by
the time you read this, some other reader may already have written
such a mode and contributed it to the public
Emacs code base.</p><p>The real point here is again a philosophical one. Don't drudge
&#8212; drudging wastes your time and productivity! If you find yourself
spending a lot of time on the low-level mechanical parts of
development, step back. Apply the Unix philosophy. Use your toolkit
to automate or semi-automate the task.</p><p>Then give back something in return for all you've inherited, by
posting your solution as open-source software to the Internet. Help
liberate your fellow programmers from drudgery, too.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2989926"/>Like an IDE, Only Better</h3></div></div><p>Earlier in this chapter we asserted that
Emacs can give you capabilities resembling
those of a conventional integrated development environment, only
better. By now you should have enough facts in hand to see how that
can be true. You can run entire development projects from inside
Emacs, driving the low-level mechanics with
a few keystrokes and saving yourself the mental effort and disruption
of constantly switching contexts.</p><p>The Emacs-enabled development style
trades away some capabilities of advanced IDEs, like graphical views
of program structure. But those are frills. What
Emacs gives you in return is flexibility
and control. You're not limited by the imagination of the IDE designer:
you can tweak, customize, and add task-related intelligence
using Emacs Lisp. Also, Emacs is better at
supporting mixed-language development than conventional IDEs.</p><p>Finally, you're not limited to accepting what one small group of
IDE developers sees fit to support. By keeping an eye on the
open-source community, you can benefit from the work of thousands of your
peers, Emacs-using developers facing
challenges much like yours. This is much more effective &#8212; and
much more fun.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2989640" href="#id2989640">138</a>] </sup>Look at
