by well-established interface design patterns. Here is a bestiary
of these patterns, with analyses and examples. We'll follow it with
a discussion of how to apply them.</p><p>Note that this bestiary does not include GUI design patterns
(though it includes a design pattern that can use a GUI as a
component). There are no design patterns in graphical user interfaces
themselves that are specifically native to Unix. A promising beginning
of a discussion of GUI design patterns in general can be found at 
<i>Experiences &#8212; A Pattern Language for User Interface
Design</i> [<a href="apb.html#Coram-Lee" title="[Coram-Lee]">Coram-Lee</a>].</p><p>Also note that programs may have modes that fit more than one
interface pattern. A program that has a compiler-like interface,
for example, may behave as a filter when no file arguments are
specified on the command line (many format converters behave like
this).</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2957637"/>The Filter Pattern</h3></div></div><p>The interface-design pattern most classically associated with
Unix is the <span class="emphasis"><em>filter</em></span>. A filter program takes data on
standard input, transforms it in some fashion, and sends the result
to standard output. Filters are not interactive; they may query
their startup environment, and are typically controlled by
command-line options, but they do not require feedback or commands
from the user in their input stream.</p><p>Two classic examples of filters are
tr(1)
and
grep(1). The
tr(1)
program is a utility that translates data on standard input to
results on standard output using a translation specification given on
the command line. The
grep(1)
program selects lines from standard input according to a match
expression specified on the command line; the resulting selected lines
go to standard output. A third is the
sort(1)
utility, which sorts lines in input according to criteria specified on
the command line and issues the sorted result to standard
output.</p><p>Both
grep(1)
and
sort(1)
(but not
tr(1))
can alternatively take data input from a file (or files) named on the
command line, in which case they do not read standard input but act
instead as though that input were the catenation of the named files
read in the order they appear. (In this case it is also expected that
specifying &#8220;-&#8221; as a filename on the command line will
direct the program explicitly to read from standard input.) The
archetype of such &#8216;catlike&#8217; filters is
cat(1),
and filters are expected to behave this way unless there are
application-specific reasons to treat files named on the command line
differently.</p><p>When designing filters, it is well to bear in mind some
additional rules, partly developed in <a href="philosophychapter.html" title="Chapter 1. Philosophy">Chapter 1</a>:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Remember Postel's Prescription: Be generous in what
you accept, rigorous in what you emit.</em></span> That is, try to
accept as loose and sloppy an input format as you can and emit as
well-structured and tight an output format as you can.  Doing the
former reduces the odds that the filter will be brittle in the face of
unexpected inputs, and break in someone's hand (or in the middle of
someone's toolchain).  Doing the latter increases the odds that your
filter will someday be useful as an input to other programs.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>When filtering, never throw away information you don't
need to.</em></span> This, too, increases the odds that your filter
will someday be useful as an input to other programs. Information you
discard is information that no later stage in a pipeline can
use.<a id="id2957821" class="indexterm"/></p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>When filtering, never add noise.</em></span> Avoid
adding nonessential information, and avoid reformatting in ways that
might make the output more difficult for downstream programs to parse.
The most common offenders are cosmetic touches like headers, footers,
blank/ruler lines, summaries and conversions like adding aligned
columns, or writing a factor of &quot;1.5&quot; as &quot;150%&quot;.  Times and dates are
a particular bother because they're hard for downstream programs to
parse. Any such additions should be optional and controlled by
switches.  If your program emits dates, it's good practice to have a
switch that can force them into ISO8601 YYYY-MM-DD and hh:mm:ss
formats &#8212; or, better yet, use those by default.</p></li></ol></div><p>The term &#8220;filter&#8221; for this pattern is
long-established Unix jargon.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>&#8220;Filter&#8221; is indeed long-established.  It came into
use on day one of pipes.  The term was a natural transferral from
electrical-engineering usage: data flowed from source through filters
to sink.  Source or sink could be either process or file.  The
collective EE term, &#8220;circuit&#8221;, was never considered,
since the plumbing metaphor for data flow was already well
established.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

<a id="id2957879" class="indexterm"/>
</span></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div><p>Some programs have interface design patterns like the filter,
but even simpler (and, importantly, even easier to script). They
are cantrips, sources, and sinks.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2957916"/>The Cantrip Pattern</h3></div></div><p>The cantrip interface design pattern is the simplest of all. No
input, no output, just an invocation and a numeric exit status. A cantrip's
behavior is controlled only by startup conditions. Programs don't
get any more scriptable than this.</p><p>Thus, the cantrip design pattern is an excellent default when
the program doesn't require any runtime interaction with the user
other than fairly simple setup of initial conditions or control
information.</p><p>Indeed, because scriptability is important, Unix designers learn
to resist the temptation to write more interactive programs when
cantrips will do. A collection of cantrips can always be driven from
an interactive wrapper or shell program<a id="id2957946" class="indexterm"/>, but interactive programs are harder
to script. Good style therefore demands that you try to find a cantrip
design for your tool before giving in to the temptation to write an
interactive interface that will be harder to script. And when
interactivity seems necessary, remember the characteristic Unix design
pattern of separating the engine from the interface; often, the right
thing is an interactive wrapper written in some scripting
language<a id="id2957963" class="indexterm"/>
that calls a cantrip to do the real work.</p><p>The console utility
clear(1),
which simply clears your screen, is the purest possible cantrip; it
doesn't even take command-line options. Other classic simple examples
are
rm(1)
and
touch(1).
The
startx(1)
program used to launch X is a complex example, typical of a whole
class of daemon-summoning cantrips.</p><p>This interface design pattern, though fairly common, has not
traditionally been named; the term &#8220;cantrip&#8221; is my
invention. (In origin, it's a Scots-dialect word for a magic spell,
which has been picked up by a popular fantasy-role-playing game to tag
a spell that can be cast instantly, with minimal or no
preparation.)</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2958032"/>The Source Pattern</h3></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>source</em></span> is a filter-like program that
requires no input; its output is controlled only by startup
conditions. The paradigmatic example would be
ls(1),
the Unix directory lister.  Other classic examples include
who(1)
and
ps(1).</p><p>Under Unix, report generators like
ls(1),
ps(1),
and
who(1)
tend strongly to obey the source pattern, so their output can be
filtered with standard tools.</p><p>The term &#8216;source&#8217; is, as Doug McIlroy noted, very
traditional. It is less common than it might be because
&#8216;source&#8217; has other important meanings.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2958116"/>The Sink Pattern</h3></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>sink</em></span> is a filter-like program that
consumes standard input but emits nothing to standard output. Again,
its actions on the input data are controlled only by startup
conditions.</p><p>This interface pattern is unusual, and there are few well-known
examples. One is
lpr(1),
the Unix print spooler. It will queue text passed to it on standard
input for printing. Like many sink programs, it will also process
files named to it on the command line.  Another example is
mail(1)
in its mail-sending mode.</p><p>Many programs that might appear at first glance to be sinks take
control information as well as data on standard input and are actually
instances of something like the <i>ed</i> pattern
(see below).</p><p>The term <i>sponge</i> is sometimes applied
specifically to sink programs like
sort(1)
that must read their entire input before they can process any of
it.</p><p>The term &#8216;sink&#8217; is traditional and common.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2958199"/>The Compiler Pattern</h3></div></div><p>Compiler-like programs use neither standard output nor standard
input; they may issue error messages to standard error, however.
Instead, a compiler-like program takes file or resource names from
the command line, transforms the names of those resources in some
way, and emits output under the transformed names. Like cantrips,
compiler-like programs do not require user interaction after
startup time.</p><p>This pattern is so named because its paradigm is the
C<a id="id2958220" class="indexterm"/> compiler,
cc(1)
(or, under Linux<a id="id2958238" class="indexterm"/> and many other modern Unixes,
gcc(1)). But
it is also widely used for programs that do (for example) graphics
file conversions or compression/decompression.</p><p>A good example of the former is the
gif2png(1)
program used to convert GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) to PNG
(Portable Network
Graphics)<a id="id2958272" class="indexterm"/>.<sup>[<a id="id2958281" href="#ftn.id2958281">108</a>]</sup> Good examples of the latter are
the
gzip(1)
and
gunzip(1)
GNU compression utilities, almost certainly shipped with your Unix
system.</p><p>In general, the compiler interface design pattern is a good
model when your program often needs to operate on multiple named
resources and can be written to have low interactivity (with its
control information supplied at startup time). Compiler-like
programs are readily scriptable.</p><p>The term &#8220;compiler-like interface&#8221; for this pattern
is well-understood in the Unix community.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2958336"/>The <i>ed</i> pattern</h3></div></div><p>All the previous patterns have very low interactivity; they use
only control information passed in at startup time, and separate
from the data. Many programs, of course, need to be driven by a
continuing dialog with the user after startup time.</p><p>In the Unix tradition, the simplest interactive design pattern
is exemplified by
ed(1),
the Unix line editor. Other classic examples of this pattern include
ftp(1)
and
sh(1),
the Unix shell.  The
ed(1)
program takes a filename argument; it modifies that file.  On its
input, it accepts command lines. Some of the commands result in output
to standard output, which is intended to be seen immediately by the
user as part of the dialog with the program.</p><p>An actual sample
ed(1)
session will be included in <a href="complexitychapter.html" title="Chapter 13. Complexity">Chapter 13</a>.</p><p>Many browserlike and editorlike programs under Unix obey this
pattern, even when the named resource they edit is something other
than a text file. Consider
gdb(1),
the GNU symbolic debugger, as an example.</p><p>Programs obeying the <i>ed</i> interface
design pattern are not quite so scriptable as would be the simpler
interface types resembling filters. You can feed them commands on
standard input, but it is trickier to generate sequences of commands
(and interpret any output they might ship back) than it is to just set
environment variables and command-line options.  If the action of the
commands is not so predictable that they can be run blind (e.g., with a
here-document as input and ignoring output), driving
<i>ed</i>-like programs requires a protocol, and a
corresponding state machine in the calling process.  This raises the
problems we noted in <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter 7. Multiprogramming">Chapter 7</a> during the discussion of slave process
control.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is the simplest and most scriptable
pattern that supports fully interactive programs. Accordingly, it
is still quite useful as a component of the &#8220;separated engine and
interface&#8221; pattern we'll describe below.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2958491"/>The Roguelike Pattern</h3></div></div><p>The roguelike pattern is so named because its first example was
the dungeon-crawling game
rogue(1)
(see <a href="#rogue" title="Figure 11.2. Screen shot of the original Rogue game.">Figure 11.2</a>) under BSD<a id="id2958515" class="indexterm"/>; the adjective &#8220;roguelike&#8221; for
this pattern is widely recognized in Unix tradition. Roguelike
programs are designed to be run on a system console, an X terminal
emulator, or a video display terminal. They use the full screen and
support a visual interface style, but with character-cell display
rather than graphics and a mouse.</p><div class="figure"><a id="rogue"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 11.2. Screen shot of the original Rogue game.</b></p><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>Commands are typically single keystrokes not echoed to the user
(as opposed to the command lines of the <i>ed</i>
pattern), though some will open a command window (often, though not
always, the last line of the screen) on which more elaborate
invocations can be typed.  The command architecture often makes heavy
use of the arrow keys to select screen locations or lines on which to
operate.</p><p>Programs written in this pattern tend to model themselves on either
vi(1)<a id="id2958617" class="indexterm"/>
or
emacs(1)
and (obeying the Rule of Least Surprise) use their command sequences
for common operations such as getting help or terminating the
program. Thus, for example, one can expect one of the commands
&#8216;x&#8217;, &#8216;q&#8217;, or &#8216;C-x C-c&#8217; to
terminate a program written to this pattern.</p><p>Some other interface tropes associated with this pattern
include: (a) the use of one-item-per-line menus, with the
currently-selected item indicated by bold or reverse-video
highlighting, and (b) &#8216;mode lines&#8217; &#8212; program status
summaries carried on a highlighted screen line, often near the bottom
or at the top of the screen.</p><p>The roguelike pattern evolved in a world of video display
terminals; many of these didn't have arrow or function keys.  In a
world of graphics-capable personal computers, with character-cell
terminals a fading memory, it's easy to forget what an influence this
pattern exerted on design; but the early exemplars of the roguelike
pattern were designed a few years before IBM standardized the PC
keyboard in 1981.  As a result, a traditional but now archaic part of
the roguelike pattern is the use of the h, j, k, and l as cursor keys
whenever they are not being interpreted as self-inserting characters
in an edit window; invariably k is up, j is down, h is left, and l is
right.  This history also explains why older Unix programs tend not to
use the ALT keys and to use function keys in a limited way if at
all.</p><p>Programs obeying this pattern are legion: The
vi(1)
text editor in all its variants, and the
emacs(1)
editor;
elm(1),
pine(1),
mutt(1)<a id="id2958717" class="indexterm"/>, and most other Unix mail readers;
tin(1),
slrn(1),
and other Usenet<a id="id2958743" class="indexterm"/>
newsreaders; the
lynx(1)
Web browser; and many others.  Most Unix programmers spend most of
their time driving programs with interfaces like these.</p><p>The roguelike pattern is hard to script; indeed scripting it is
seldom even attempted. Among other things, this pattern uses raw-mode
character-by-character input, which is inconvenient for scripting.
It's also quite hard to interpret the output programmatically, because
it usually consists of sequences of incremental screen-painting
actions.</p><p>Nor does this pattern have the visual slickness of a mouse-driven
full GUI. While the point of using the full screen interface is to
support simple kinds of direct-manipulation and menu interfaces,
roguelike programs still require users to learn a command
repertoire. Indeed, interfaces built on the roguelike pattern show a
tendency to degenerate into a sort of cluttered wilderness of modes
and meta-shift-cokebottle commands that only hard-core
hackers<a id="id2958786" class="indexterm"/> can love. It
would seem that this pattern has the worst of both worlds, being
neither scriptable nor conforming to recent fashions in design for
end-users.</p><p>But there must be some value in this pattern. Roguelike mailers,
newsreaders, editors, and other programs remain extremely popular even
among people who invariably run them through terminal emulators on an
X display that supports GUI competitors. Moreover, the roguelike
pattern is so pervasive that under Unix even GUI programs often
emulate it, adding mouse and graphics support to a command and display
interface that still looks rather roguelike.  The X mode of
emacs(1),
and the
xchat(1)
client are good examples of such adaptation. What accounts for the
pattern's continuing popularity?</p><p>Efficiency, and perceived efficiency, seem to be important
factors. Roguelike programs tend to be fast and lightweight
relative to their nearest GUI competitors. For startup and runtime
speed, running a roguelike program in an Xterm may be preferable to
invoking a GUI that will chew up substantial resources setting up
its displays and respond more slowly afterwards. Also, programs
with a roguelike design pattern can be used over telnet links or
low-speed dialup lines for which X is not an option.</p><p>Touch-typists often prefer roguelike programs because they can
avoid taking their hands off the keyboard to move a mouse.  Given a
choice, touch-typists will prefer interfaces that minimize keystrokes
far off the home row; this may account for a significant percentage of
vi(1)'s
popularity.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, roguelike interfaces are predictable
and sparing in their use of screen real estate on an X display;
they do not clutter the display with multiple windows, frame
widgets, dialog boxes, or other GUI impedimenta. This makes the
pattern well suited for use in programs that must frequently share
the user's attention with other programs (as is especially the case
with editors, mailers, newsreaders, chat clients, and other
communication programs).</p><p>Finally (and probably most importantly) the roguelike pattern
tends to appeal more than GUIs to people who value the concision and
expressiveness of a command set enough to tolerate the added mnemonic
load. We saw above that there are good reasons for this preference to
become more common as task complexity, use frequency, and user
experience rise. The roguelike pattern meets this preference while
also supporting GUI-like elements of direct manipulation as an
<i>ed</i>-pattern program cannot. Thus, far from
having only the worst of both worlds, the roguelike interface design
pattern can capture some of the best.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2958899"/>The &#8216;Separated Engine and Interface&#8217; Pattern</h3></div></div><p>In <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter 7. Multiprogramming">Chapter 7</a> we
argued against building monster single-process monoliths, and that it
is often possible to lower the global complexity of programs by
splitting them into communicating pieces.  In the Unix world, this
tactic is frequently applied by separating the &#8216;engine&#8217;
part of the program (core algorithms and logic specific to its
application domain) from the &#8216;interface&#8217; part (which
accepts user commands, displays results, and may provide services such
as interactive help or command history).  In fact, this
separated-engine-and-interface pattern is probably the one most
characteristic interface design pattern of Unix.</p><p>(The other, more obvious candidate for that distinction would be
filters.  But filters are more often found in non-Unix environments
than engine/interface pairs with bidirectional traffic between them.
Simulating pipelines is easy; the more sophisticated IPC mechanisms 
required for engine/interface pairs are hard.)</p><p>Owen Taylor, maintainer of the GTK+ library widely used for
writing user interfaces under X, beautifully brings out the
engineering benefits of this kind of partitioning at the end of his
note <a href="http://www.gtk.org/setuid.html" target="_top">Why GTK_MODULES is
not a security hole</a>; he finishes by writing &quot;[T]he
secure setuid program is a 500 line program that does only what it
needs to, rather than a 500,000 line library whose essential task is
user interfaces&quot;.</p><p>This is not a new idea. Xerox PARC's<a id="id2958962" class="indexterm"/> early research into graphical user
interfaces led them to propose the
&#8220;model-view-controller&#8221;<a id="id2958974" class="indexterm"/> pattern as an archetype for
GUIs.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The &#8220;model&#8221; is what in the Unix world is usually
called an &#8220;engine&#8221;.  The model contains the
domain-specific data structures and logic for your application.
Database servers are archetypal examples of models.</p></li><li><p>The &#8220;view&#8221; part is what renders your domain objects
into a visible form.  In a really well-separated model/view/controller
application, the view component is notified of updates to the model
and responds on its own, rather than being driven synchronously by
the controller or by explicit requests for a refresh.</p></li><li><p>The &#8220;controller&#8221; processes user requests and passes
them as commands to the model.</p></li></ul></div><p>In practice, the view and controller parts tend to be more
closely bound together than either is to the model.  Most GUIs, for
example, combine view and controller behavior.  They tend to be
separated only when the application demands multiple views of the
model.</p><p>Under Unix, application of the model/view/controller pattern is
far more common than elsewhere precisely because there is a strong
&#8220;do one thing well&#8221; tradition, and IPC methods are both
easy and flexible.</p><p>An especially powerful form of this technique couples a policy
interface (often a GUI combining view and controller functions) with
an engine (model) that contains an interpreter for a domain-specific
minilanguage.  We examined this pattern in <a href="minilanguageschapter.html" title="Chapter 8. Minilanguages">Chapter 8</a>, focusing on minilanguage design; now
it's time to look at the different ways that such engines can form
components of larger systems of code.</p><p>There are several major variants of this pattern.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2959084"/>Configurator/Actor Pair</h4></div></div><p>In a configurator/actor pair, the interface part controls the

and
fetchmailconf(1)
(which we've already used as case studies in
discoverability<a id="id2959125" class="indexterm"/>
and data-driven programming and will encounter again as language case
studies in <a href="languageschapter.html" title="Chapter 14. Languages">Chapter 14</a>) are
a good example of a configurator/actor pair.
<i>fetchmailconf</i> is the interactive dotfile
configurator that ships with
fetchmail<a id="id2959152" class="indexterm"/>.
<i>fetchmailconf</i> can also serve as a GUI
wrapper that runs fetchmail in either foreground or background
mode.</p><p>This design pattern enables both
<i>fetchmail</i> and
<i>fetchmailconf</i> to specialize in what they do
well, and indeed to be written in different languages appropriate to
their task domains. Fetchmail, which usually runs in background as a
daemon, need not be bloated with GUI code. Conversely,
<i>fetchmailconf</i> can specialize in elaborate
GUIness without exacting size and complexity costs from
fetchmail. Finally, because the information channels between them are
narrow and well-defined, it remains possible to drive
<i>fetchmail</i> from the command line and from
scripts other than <i>fetchmailconf</i>.</p><p>The term &#8220;configurator/actor&#8221; is my invention.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2959228"/>Spooler/Daemon Pair</h4></div></div><p>A slight variant of the configurator/actor pair can be useful in
situations that require serialized access to a shared resource in a
batch mode; that is, when a well-defined job stream or sequence
of requests requires some shared resource, but no individual
job requires user interaction.</p><p>In this spooler/daemon pattern, the spooler or front end simply
drops job requests and data in a spool area. The job requests and data
are simply files; the spool area is typically just a directory. The
location of the directory and the format of the job requests are agreed
on by the spooler and daemon.</p><p>The daemon runs forever in background, polling the spool
directory, looking there for work to do. When it finds a job request,
it tries to process the associated data. If it succeeds, the job
request and data are deleted out of the spool area.</p><p>The classic example of this pattern is the Unix print spooler
system,
lpr(1)/lpd(1). The
front end is
lpr(1);
it simply drops files to be printed in a spool area periodically
scanned by
<i>lpd</i>. <i>lpd</i>'s job
is simply to serialize access to the printer devices.</p><p>Another classic example is the pair
at(1)/atd(1),
which schedules commands for execution at specified times. A
third example, historically important though no longer in wide use,
was UUCP &#8212; the Unix-to-Unix Copy Program commonly used as a mail
transport over dial-up lines before the Internet explosion of the
early 1990s.</p><p>The spooler/daemon pattern remains important in mail-transport
programs (which are batchy by nature). The front ends of mail
transports such as
sendmail(1)
and
qmail(1)
usually make one try at delivering mail immediately, through SMTP over an
outbound Internet connection. If that attempt fails, the mail will
fall into a spool area; a daemon version or mode of the mail transport
will retry the delivery later.</p><p>Typically, a spooler/daemon system has four parts: a job
launcher, a queue lister, a job-cancellation utility, and a
spooling daemon, In fact, the presence of the first three parts is
a sure clue that there is a spooler daemon behind them
somewhere.</p><p>The terms &#8220;spooler&#8221; and &#8220;daemon&#8221; are
well-established Unix jargon. (&#8216;Spooler&#8217; actually
dates back to early mainframe days.)</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2959389"/>Driver/Engine Pair</h4></div></div><p>In this pattern, unlike a configurator/actor or spooler/server
pair, the interface part supplies commands to and interprets output
from an engine after startup; the engine has a simpler interface
pattern. The IPC method used is an implementation detail; the engine
may be a slave process of the driver (in the sense we discussed in
<a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter 7. Multiprogramming">Chapter 7</a>) or the
engine and driver may communicate through sockets, or shared memory,
or any other IPC method. The key points are (a) the interactivity of
the pair, and (b) the ability of the engine to run standalone with its
own interface.</p><p>Such pairs are trickier to write than configurator/actor pairs
because they are more tightly and intricately coupled; the driver
must have knowledge not merely about the engine's expected startup
environment but about its command set and response formats as well.</p><p>When the engine has been designed for scriptability, however, it
is not uncommon for the driver part to be written by someone other
than the engine author, or for more than one driver to front-end a
given engine. An excellent example of both is provided by the programs
gv(1)
and
ghostview(1),
which are drivers for
gs(1),
the Ghostscript interpreter. GhostScript renders PostScript to various
graphics formats and lower-level printer-control languages. The gv and
ghostview programs provide GUI wrappers for GhostScript's rather
idiosyncratic invocation switches and command syntax.</p><p>Another excellent example of this pattern is the <i>xcdroast</i>/<i>cdrtools</i><a id="id2959488" class="indexterm"/>
combination.  The cdrtools distribution provides a program
cdrecord(1)
with a command-line interface.  The
<i>cdrecord</i> code specializes in knowing
everything about talking to CD-ROM hardware.
<i>xcdroast</i> is a GUI; it specializes in
providing a pleasant user experience.  The
xcdroast(1)<a id="id2959530" class="indexterm"/>
program calls
cdrecord(1)
to do most of its work.</p><div class="figure"><a id="id2959548"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 11.3. The Xcdroast GUI.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/xcdr-read.png" alt="The Xcdroast GUI."/></div></div><p><i>xcdroast</i> also calls other CLI tools:
cdda2wav(1)
(a sound file converter) and
mkisofs(1)
(a tool for creating ISO-9660 CD-ROM file system images from a list of
files).  The details of how these tools are invoked are hidden from
the user, who can think in terms centered on the task of making CDs
rather than having to know directly about the arcana of sound-file
conversion or file-system structure.  Equally important, the
implementers of each of these tools can concentrate on their
domain-specific expertise without having to be user-interface
experts.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>A key pitfall of driver/engine organization is that frequently
the driver must understand the state of the engine in order to reflect
it to the user.  If the engine action is practically instantaneous,
it's not a problem, but if the engine can take a long time (e.g., when
accessing many URLs) the lack of feedback can be a significant issue.
A similar problem is responding to errors.  For example, the
traditional (although not very Unix-like) confirmation question about
whether it's OK to overwrite a file that already exists is kind of
painful to write in the driver/engine world; the engine, which detects
the problem, has to ask the driver to do the confirmation prompting.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

right thing, but also notifies the driver about what it's doing so
the driver can present a graceful interface with appropriate feedback.</p><p>The terms &#8220;driver&#8221; and &#8220;engine&#8221; are
uncommon but established in the Unix community.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2959688"/>Client/Server Pair</h4></div></div><p>A client/server pair is like a driver/engine pair, except that
the engine part is a daemon running in background which is not
expected to be run interactively, and does not have its own user
interface. Usually, the daemon is designed to mediate access to
some sort of shared resource &#8212; a database, or a transaction
stream, or specialized shared hardware such as a sound device.
Another reason for such a daemon may be to avoid performing 
expensive startup actions each time the program is invoked.</p><p>Yesterday's paradigmatic example was the
ftp(1)/ftpd(1)
pair that implements FTP, the File Transfer Protocol; or perhaps two
instances of
sendmail(1),
sender in foreground and listener in background, passing Internet
email. Today's would have to be any browser/web server pair.</p><p>However, this pattern is not limited to communication programs;
another important case is in databases, such as the
psql(1)/postmaster(1)
pair. In this one, <i>psql</i> serializes access
to a shared database managed by the postgres daemon, passing it SQL
requests and presenting data sent back as responses.</p><p>These examples illustrate an important property of such pairs,
which is that the cleanliness of the protocol that serializes
communication between them is all-important. If it is well-defined
and described by an open standard, it can become a tremendous
opportunity for leverage by insulating client programs from the
details of how the server's resource is managed, and allowing
clients and servers to evolve semi-independently. All
separated-engine-and-interface programs potentially get this kind
of benefit from clean separation of function, but in the
client/server case the payoffs for getting it right tend to be
particularly high exactly because managing shared resources is
intrinsically difficult.</p><p>Message queues and pairs of named
pipes<a id="id2959796" class="indexterm"/> can be and have
been used for front-end/back-end communication, but the benefits of
being able to run the server on a different machine from the client
are so great that nowadays almost all modern client-server pairs use
TCP/IP<a id="id2959809" class="indexterm"/> sockets.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2959821"/>The CLI Server Pattern</h3></div></div><p>It's normal in the Unix world for server processes to be invoked
by harness programs<sup>[<a id="id2959831" href="#ftn.id2959831">109</a>]</sup> such as
inetd(8)
in such a way that the server sees commands on standard input and
ships responses to standard output; the harness program then takes
care of ensuring that the server's stdin and stdout are connected to a
specified TCP/IP<a id="id2959855" class="indexterm"/>
service port.  One benefit of this division of labor is that the
harness program can act as a single security gatekeeper for all of the
servers it launches.</p><p>One of the classic interface patterns is therefore a CLI server.
This is a program which, when invoked in a foreground mode, has a
simple CLI interface reading from standard input and writing to
standard output.  When backgrounded, the server detects this and
connects its standard input and standard output to a specified
TCP/IP<a id="id2959877" class="indexterm"/> service
port.</p><p>In some variants of this pattern, the server backgrounds itself
by default, and has to be told with a command-line switch when it
should stay in foreground.  This is a detail; the essential point is
that most of the code neither knows nor cares whether it is running in
foreground or a TCP/IP<a id="id2959895" class="indexterm"/>
harness.</p><p>POP, IMAP, SMTP, and HTTP servers normally obey this pattern.
It can be combined with any of the server/client patterns described
earlier in this chapter.  An HTTP server can also act as a harness
program; the CGI scripts that supply most live content on the Web run
in a special environment provided by the server where they can take
input (form arguments) from standard input, and write the generated
HTML that is their result to standard output.</p><p>Though this pattern is quite traditional, the term &#8220;CLI
server&#8221; is my invention.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2959928"/>Language-Based Interface Patterns</h3></div></div><p>In <a href="minilanguageschapter.html" title="Chapter 8. Minilanguages">Chapter 8</a> we
examined domain-specific minilanguages as a means of pushing program
specification up a level, gaining flexibility, and minimizing bugs.
These virtues make the language-based CLI an important style of Unix
interface &#8212; one exemplified by the Unix shell itself.</p><p>The strengths of this pattern are well illustrated by the case
study earlier in the chapter comparing
dc(1)/bc(1)
with
xcalc(1).
The advantages that we observed earlier (the gain in expressiveness
and scriptability) are typical of minilanguages; they generalize to
other situations in which you routinely have to sequence complex
operations in a specialized problem domain. Often, unlike the
calculator case, minilanguages also have a clear advantage in
concision.</p><p>One of the most potent Unix design patterns is the combination
of a GUI front end with a CLI minilanguage back end.  Well-designed
examples of this type are necessarily rather complex, but often a
great deal simpler and more flexible than the amount of ad-hoc code
that would be necessary to cover even a fraction of what the
minilanguage can do.</p><p>This general pattern is not, of course, unique to Unix. Modern
database suites everywhere normally consist of one or more GUI
front ends and report generators, all of which talk to a common
back-end using a query language such as SQL. But this pattern
mainly evolved under Unix and is still much better understood and
more widely applied there than elsewhere.</p><p>When the front and back ends of a system fulfilling this design
pattern are combined in a single program, that program is often said
to have an &#8216;embedded scripting
language&#8217;<a id="id2960017" class="indexterm"/>.  In the Unix world,
<i>Emacs</i> is one of the best-known exemplars of
this pattern; refer to our discussion of it in <a href="minilanguageschapter.html" title="Chapter 8. Minilanguages">Chapter 8</a> for some advantages.</p><p>The script-fu facility of
GIMP<a id="id2960044" class="indexterm"/> is another good
example. GIMP is a powerful open-source graphics editor.  It has a GUI
resembling that of Adobe Photoshop.  Script-fu allows GIMP to be
scripted using Scheme (a dialect of Lisp<a id="id2960056" class="indexterm"/>); scripting through
Tcl<a id="id2960065" class="indexterm"/>, or
Perl<a id="id2960074" class="indexterm"/> or
Python<a id="id2960082" class="indexterm"/> is
also available.  Programs written in any of these languages can call
GIMP internals through its plugin interface.  The demonstration
application for this facility is a Web page<sup>[<a id="id2960094" href="#ftn.id2960094">110</a>]</sup> which allows people to
construct simple logos and graphic buttons through a CGI interface
that passes a generated Scheme program to an instance of GIMP, and
returns a finished image.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2958281" href="#id2958281">108</a>] </sup>Sources for this program, and other converters with
