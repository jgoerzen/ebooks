put on modularity and well-defined APIs is a strong tendency to
factor programs into bits of glue connecting collections of
libraries, especially shared libraries (the equivalents of what are
called dynamically-linked libraries or DLLs under Windows and
other operating systems).</p><p>If you are careful and clever about design, it is often possible
to partition a program so that it consists of a
user-interface-handling main section (policy) and a collection of
service routines (mechanism) with effectively no glue at all.  This
approach is especially appropriate when the program has to do a lot of
very specific manipulations of data structures like graphic images,
network-protocol packets, or control blocks for a hardware interface.
Some good general architectural advice from within the Unix tradition,
particularly applicable to the resource-management challenges of this
sort of library is collected in <i>The Discipline and Method
Architecture for Reusable Libraries</i> [<a href="apb.html#Vo" title="[Vo]">Vo</a>].</p><p>Under Unix, it is normal practice to make this layering
explicit, with the service routines collected in a library that is
separately documented.  In such programs, the front end gets to
specialize in user-interface considerations and high-level protocol.
With a little more care in design, it may be possible to detach the
original front end and replace it with others adapted for different
purposes.  Some other advantages should become evident from our case
study.</p><p>There is a flip side to this. In the Unix world, libraries which
are delivered <span class="emphasis"><em>as libraries</em></span> should come with
exerciser programs.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>APIs should come with programs, and vice versa.  An API that you
must write C code to use, which cannot be invoked easily from the
command line, is harder to learn and use.  And contrariwise, it's a
royal pain to have interfaces whose <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> open,

excellent test frameworks.  Experienced Unix programmers therefore see
them not just as a form of thoughtfulness to the library's users but
as an indication that the code has probably been well tested.</p><p>An important form of library layering is the
<i>plugin</i>, a library with a set of known entry
points that is dynamically loaded after startup time to perform a
specialized task.  For plugins to work, the calling program has to be
organized largely as a documented service library that the plugin can
call back into.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gimp_plugins"/>Case Study: GIMP Plugins</h3></div></div><a id="id2900365" class="indexterm"/><p>The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation
program)<a id="id2900380" class="indexterm"/> is a graphics
editor designed to be driven through an interactive GUI.  But GIMP is
built as a library of image-manipulation and housekeeping routines
called by a relatively thin layer of control code.  The driver code
knows about the GUI, but not directly about image formats; the library
routines reverse this by knowing about image formats and operations
but not about the GUI.</p><p>The library layer is documented (and, in fact shipped as
&#8220;libgimp&#8221; for use by other programs).  This means that C
programs called &#8220;plugins&#8221; can be dynamically loaded by
GIMP and call the library to do image manipulation, effectively taking
over control at the same level as the GUI (see <a href="#libgimp" title="Figure 4.2. Caller/callee relationships in GIMP with a plugin loaded.">Figure 4.2</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="libgimp"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 4.2. Caller/callee relationships in GIMP with a plugin loaded.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/gimp-org.png" alt="Caller/callee relationships in GIMP with a plugin loaded."/></div></div><p>Plugins are used to perform lots of special-purpose
transformations such as colormap hacking, blurring and despeckling;
also for reading and writing file formats not native to the GIMP core;
for extensions like editing animations and window manager themes; and
for lots of other sorts of image-hacking that can be automated by
scripting the image-hacking logic in the GIMP core.  A registry of
GIMP plugins is available on the World Wide Web.</p><p>Though most GIMP plugins are small, simple
C<a id="id2900491" class="indexterm"/> programs, it is
also possible to write a plugin that exposes the library API to a
scripting language<a id="id2900501" class="indexterm"/>; we'll discuss this possibility in
<a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter 11. Interfaces">Chapter 11</a> when we examine
the &#8216;polyvalent program&#8217; pattern.</p></div></div></body></html>
