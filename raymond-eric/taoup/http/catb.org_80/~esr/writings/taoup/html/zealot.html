Great Way, came to him for instruction.  Master Foo said to him:</p><p>&#8220;When the Patriarch Thompson invented Unix, he did not
understand it.  Then he gained in understanding, and no longer invented
it&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;When the Patriarch McIlroy invented the pipe, he knew
that it would transform software, but did not know that it would 
transform mind&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;When the Patriarch Ritchie invented C, he condemned 
programmers to a thousand hells of buffer overruns, heap corruption,
and stale-pointer bugs&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;Truly, the Patriarchs were blind and foolish!&#8221;</p><p>The zealot was greatly angered by the Master's words.</p><p>&#8220;These enlightened ones&#8221;, he protested. &#8220;gave
us the Great Way of Unix.  Surely, if we mock them we will lose merit
and be reborn as beasts or MCSEs&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;Is your code ever completely without stain and
flaw?&#8221; demanded Master Foo.</p><p>&#8220;No&#8221;, admitted the zealot, &#8220;no man's
is&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;The wisdom of the Patriarchs&#8221;, said Master Foo,
&#8220;was that they <span class="emphasis"><em>knew</em></span> they were
fools&#8221;.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the zealot was enlightened.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="gui-programmer.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="unix_koans.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="unix-nature.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Master Foo Discourses on the
