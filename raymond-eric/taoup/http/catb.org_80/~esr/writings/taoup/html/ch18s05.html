DocBook as a standard format for their documentation.  The advocates
of XML-based markup seem to have won the theoretical argument against
presentation-level and for structural-level markup, and an effective
XML-DocBook toolchain is available in open source.</p><p>Nevertheless, a lot of confusion still surrounds DocBook and the
programs that support it.  Its devotees speak an argot that is dense
and forbidding even by computer-science standards, slinging around
acronyms that have no obvious relationship to the things you need to
do to write markup and make HTML or PostScript from it.  XML standards
and technical papers are notoriously obscure. In the rest of this
section, we'll try to dispel the fog of jargon.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3006015"/>Document Type Definitions</h3></div></div><p>(Note: to keep the explanation simple, most of this section
tells some lies, mainly by omitting a lot of history.  Truthfulness
will be fully restored in a following section.)</p><p>DocBook is a structural-level markup language.  Specifically, it
is a dialect of XML.  A DocBook document is a piece of XML that uses
XML tags for structural markup.</p><p>For a document formatter to apply a stylesheet to your document
and make it look good, it needs to know things about the overall
structure of your document.  For example, in order to physically
format chapter headers properly, it needs to know that a book
manuscript normally consists of front matter, a sequence of chapters,
and back matter.  In order for it to know this sort of thing, you
need to give it a <i>Document Type
Definition</i><a id="id3006049" class="indexterm"/> or DTD. The
DTD tells your formatter what sorts of elements can be in the document
structure, and in what order they can appear.</p><p>What we mean by calling DocBook a &#8216;dialect&#8217; of XML
is actually that DocBook is a DTD &#8212; a rather large DTD, with
somewhere around 400 tags in it.<sup>[<a id="id3006067" href="#ftn.id3006067">152</a>]</sup></p><p>Lurking behind DocBook is a kind of program called a
<i>validating parser</i><a id="id3006082" class="indexterm"/>. When you format a DocBook document, the
first step is to pass it through a validating parser (the front end of
the DocBook formatter).  This program checks your document against the
DocBook DTD to make sure you aren't breaking any of the DTD's
structural rules (otherwise the back end of the formatter, the part
that applies your stylesheet, might become quite confused).</p><p>The validating parser will either throw an error, giving you messages
about places where the document structure is broken, or translate the
document into a stream of XML elements and text that the parser back
end combines with the information in your stylesheet to produce
formatted output.</p><p><a href="#docfig1" title="Figure 18.1. Processing structural documents.">Figure 18.1</a> diagrams the whole process.</p><div class="figure"><a id="docfig1"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 18.1. Processing structural documents.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/docflow1.png" alt="Processing structural documents."/></div></div><p>The part of the diagram inside the dotted box is your formatting
software, or <i>toolchain</i>. Besides the obvious and
visible input to the formatter (the document source) you'll need to
keep the two hidden inputs of the formatter (DTD and stylesheet) in
mind to understand what follows.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3006182"/>Other DTDs</h3></div></div><p>A brief digression into other DTDs may help clarify what parts of
the previous section are specific to DocBook and what parts are general to
all structural-markup languages.</p><p><a href="http://www.tei-c.org/" target="_top">TEI</a> (Text Encoding
Initiative) is a large, elaborate DTD used primarily in academia for
computer transcription of literary texts.  TEI's Unix-based toolchains
use many of the same tools that are involved with DocBook, but with
different stylesheets and (of course) a different DTD.</p><p>XHTML, the latest version of HTML, is also an XML application
described by a DTD, which explains the family resemblance between
XHTML and DocBook tags. The XHTML toolchain consists of Web browsers
that can format HTML as flat ASCII, together with any of a number of
ad-hoc HTML-to-print utilities.</p><p>Many other XML DTDs are maintained to help people exchange
structured information in fields as diverse as bioinformatics and
banking.  You can look at a <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/rg/DTD_Repositories" target="_top">list of
repositories</a> to get some idea of the variety available.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="db_toolchain"/>The DocBook Toolchain</h3></div></div><a id="id3006245" class="indexterm"/><p>Normally, what you'll do to make XHTML from your DocBook sources
is use the
xmlto(1)
front end.  Your commands will look like this:</p><pre class="screen">
bash$ xmlto xhtml foo.xml
bash$ ls *.html
ar01s02.html ar01s03.html ar01s04.html index.html
</pre><p>In this example, you converted an XML-DocBook  document named 
<tt>foo.xml</tt> with three top-level sections into an
index page and two parts.  Making one big page is just as easy:</p><pre class="screen">
bash$ xmlto xhtml-nochunks foo.xml
bash$ ls *.html
foo.html
</pre><p>Finally, here is how you make PostScript for printing:</p><pre class="screen">
bash$ xmlto ps foo.xml       # To make PostScript
bash$ ls *.ps
foo.ps
</pre><p>To turn your documents into HTML or PostScript, you need an
engine that can apply the combination of DocBook DTD and a suitable
stylesheet to your document.  <a href="#docfig2" title="Figure 18.2. Present-day XML-DocBook toolchain.">Figure 18.2</a> illustrates how
the open-source tools for doing this fit together.</p><div class="figure"><a id="docfig2"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 18.2. Present-day XML-DocBook toolchain.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/docflow2.png" alt="Present-day XML-DocBook toolchain."/></div></div><p>Parsing your document and applying the stylesheet transformation
will be handled by one of three programs.  The most likely one is
<i>xsltproc</i><a id="id3006388" class="indexterm"/>,
the parser that ships with Red Hat Linux<a id="id3006397" class="indexterm"/>.  The other possibilities are two
Java<a id="id3006409" class="indexterm"/> programs,
<i>Saxon</i> and
<i>Xalan</i>.</p><p>It is relatively easy to generate high-quality XHTML from either
DocBook; the fact that XHTML is simply another XML DTD helps a lot.
Translation to HTML is done by applying a rather simple stylesheet,
and that's the end of the story.  RTF is also simple to generate in
this way, and from XHTML or RTF it's easy to generate a flat ASCII
text approximation in a pinch.</p><p>The awkward case is print.  Generating high-quality printed
output &#8212; which means, in practice, Adobe's
PDF<a id="id3006449" class="indexterm"/>
(Portable Document Format) &#8212; is difficult.  Doing it right requires
algorithmically duplicating the delicate judgments of a human
typesetter moving from content to presentation level.</p><p>So, first, a stylesheet translates DocBook's structural markup
into another dialect of XML &#8212; FO<a id="id3006466" class="indexterm"/> (Formatting Objects).  FO
markup is very much presentation-level; you can think of it as a sort
of XML functional equivalent of <i>troff</i>.  It
has to be translated to PostScript for packaging in a PDF.</p><p>In the toolchain shipped with Red Hat
Linux<a id="id3006490" class="indexterm"/>, this job
is handled by a <i>TeX</i> macro package called
<i>PassiveTeX</i><a id="id3006519" class="indexterm"/>. It
translates the formatting objects generated by
<b>xsltproc</b> into Donald
Knuth's<a id="id3006535" class="indexterm"/>
<i>TeX</i> language.
<i>TeX</i>'s output, known as
DVI<a id="id3006563" class="indexterm"/> (DeVice Independent) format, is then
massaged into PDF<a id="id3006573" class="indexterm"/>.</p><p>If you think this bucket chain of XML to <i>TeX</i> macros to DVI to
PDF sounds like an awkward kludge, you're right.  It clanks, it
wheezes, and it has ugly warts.  Fonts are a significant problem,
since XML and <i>TeX</i> and PDF have very
different models of how fonts work; also, handling
internationalization and localization is a nightmare. About the only
thing this code path has going for it is that it works.</p><p>The elegant way will be
FOP<a id="id3006615" class="indexterm"/>, a direct
FO-to-PostScript translator being developed by the
Apache<a id="id3006625" class="indexterm"/> project.  With
FOP, the internationalization problem is, if not solved, at least well
confined; XML tools handle Unicode all the way through to FOP.  The
mapping from Unicode glyphs to Postscript font is also strictly FOP's
problem.  The only trouble with this approach is that it doesn't work
&#8212; yet.  As of mid-2003, FOP is in an unfinished alpha state
&#8212; usable, but with rough edges and missing features.</p><p><a href="#docfig3" title="Figure 18.3. Future XML-DocBook toolchain with FOP.">Figure 18.3</a> illustrates what the FOP toolchain looks
like.</p><div class="figure"><a id="docfig3"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 18.3. Future XML-DocBook toolchain with FOP.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/docflow3.png" alt="Future XML-DocBook toolchain with FOP."/></div></div><p>FOP has competition.  Another project called
<i>xsl-fo-proc</i> aims to do the same
things as FOP, but in C++<a id="id3006712" class="indexterm"/> (and therefore both faster than
Java<a id="id3006722" class="indexterm"/> and not
relying on the Java environment).  As of mid-2003,
<i>xsl-fo-proc</i> is in an unfinished alpha
state, not as far along as FOP.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3006742"/>Migration Tools</h3></div></div><p>The second biggest problem with DocBook is the effort needed to
convert old-style presentation markup to DocBook markup.  Human beings
can usually parse the presentation of a document into logical
structure automatically, because (for example) they can tell from 
context when an italic font means &#8216;emphasis&#8217; and when it means
something else such as &#8216;this is a foreign phrase&#8217;.</p><p>Somehow, in converting documents to DocBook, those
sorts of distinctions need to be made explicit.  Sometimes
they're present in the old markup; often they are not, and the
missing  structural information has to be either deduced by 
clever heuristics or added by a human.</p><p>Here is a summary of the state of conversion tools from
various other formats.  None of these do a completely perfect job;
inspection and perhaps a bit of hand-editing by a human being
will be needed after conversion.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">GNU Texinfo</span></dt><dd><p>The Free Software Foundation<a id="id3006792" class="indexterm"/> intends to support DocBook as an
interchange format.  Texinfo has enough structure to make reasonably
good automatic conversion possible (human editing is still needed
afterwards, but not much of it), and the 4.x versions of
<i>makeinfo</i> feature a
<tt>--docbook</tt> switch that generates DocBook.  More at the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/texinfo.html" target="_top"><i>makeinfo</i>

module translates Plain Old Documentation markup to DocBook.  It
claims to translate every POD tag except the L&lt;&gt; italic tag.
The man page also says &#8220;Nested =over/=back lists are not supported
within DocBook&#8221;, but notes that the module has been heavily
tested.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><i>LaTeX</i></span></dt><dd><p>A project called <a href="http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/services/software/sonstiges/tex4ht/mn.html" target="_top">
TeX4ht</a> can, according to the author of Passive<i>TeX</i>, 
generate DocBook from <i>LaTeX</i>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">man pages and other <i>troff</i>-based markups</span></dt><dd><p>These are generally considered the biggest and nastiest conversion
problems.  And indeed, the basic
troff(1) markup is at too low a presentation
level for automatic conversion tools to do much of any good.  However,
the gloom in the picture lightens significantly if we consider
translation from sources of documents written in macro packages like
man(7).  These have enough structural
features for automatic translation to get some traction.</p><p>I wrote a tool to do troff-to-DocBook
myself, because I couldn't find anything else that did a tolerable
job of it.  It's called <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/doclifter/" target="_top">doclifter</a>.  It
will translate to either SGML or XML DocBook from
man(7),
mdoc(7),
ms(7), or
me(7) macros.  See the documentation
for details.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3007022"/>Editing Tools</h3></div></div><p>One thing we do not have in mid-2003 is a good
open-source structure editor for SGML/XML documents.</p><p><a href="http://www.lyx.org/" target="_top">LyX</a> is a GUI word processor
that uses <i>LaTeX</i> for printing and supports structural editing of <i>LaTeX</i>
markup.  There is a <i>LaTeX</i> package that generates DocBook, and a

describing how to write SGML and XML in the LyX GUI.</p><p><a href="http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~anh/TeXmacs/TeXmacs.html" target="_top"> GNU
<i>TeX</i>Macs</a> is a project aimed at producing an editor that is good
for technical and mathematical material, including displayed formulas.
1.0 was released in April 2002.  The developers plan XML support in
the future, but it's not there yet.</p><p>Most people still hack DocBook tags by hand using either
<i>vi</i> or
<i>emacs</i>.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3007143"/>Related Standards and Practices</h3></div></div><p>The tools are coming together, if slowly, to edit and format
DocBook markup. But DocBook itself is a means, not an end.  We'll need
other standards besides DocBook itself to accomplish the
searchable-documentation-database objective. There are two big issues:
document cataloging and metadata.</p><p>The <a href="http://scrollkeeper.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ScrollKeeper</a>
project aims directly to meet this need. It provides a simple set of
script hooks that can be used by package install and uninstall
productions to register and unregister their documentation.</p><p>ScrollKeeper uses the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/osrt/omf/" target="_top">Open Metadata Format</a>.
This is a standard for indexing open-source documentation analogous to
a library card-catalog system.  The idea is to support rich search
facilities that use the card-catalog metadata as well as the source 
text of the documentation itself.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3007192"/>SGML</h3></div></div><p>In previous sections, we have deliberately omitted a lot of
DocBook's history.  XML has an older brother,
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML<a id="id3007203" class="indexterm"/>).</p><p>Until mid-2002, no discussion of DocBook would have been
complete without a long excursion into SGML, the differences between
SGML and XML, and detailed descriptions of the SGML DocBook toolchain.
