studies.  It will be helpful to bear in mind a set of benchmark
tasks as we examine these designs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Plain-text editing.</em></span> Manipulating
plain ASCII (or, in this internationalized age, perhaps Unicode) files
with no structure known to the editor above byte level, or perhaps
line level.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Rich-text editing.</em></span>  Editing of text
with attributes; these might include font changes, color, or other sorts of
properties of text spans (such as being a hyperlink).  Editors that can
do this have to be able to translate between some presentation of the
attributes in the user interface and some on-disk representation of
the data (such as HTML, XML, or other rich-text formats.)</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Syntax awareness.</em></span>  An editor that
is syntax-aware knows that input events have a grammar, and does things like
automatically changing the indent level when it recognizes the
beginning or end of a block scope in a programming language.  Editors
that are syntax-aware also commonly highlight syntax with colors
or distinguished fonts.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Output parsing</em></span> of batch command
output. The commonest case of this in the Unix world is running a C
compilation from inside the editor, trapping the error messages, and
then being able to step through the error locations without leaving the
editor.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Interaction</em></span> with helper
subprocesses that persist and maintain state between editor commands.
This capability, when present, has powerful consequences:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>It's possible to drive a version-control system
    from inside the editor, performing file checkins and checkouts
    without dropping out to a shell window or separate
    utility.</p></li><li><p>It's possible to front-end a symbolic debugger
    inside the editor, such that (for example) when the run stops on a
    breakpoint the appropriate file and line is automatically
    visited.</p></li><li><p>It's possible to edit remote files within the
    editor, by having it recognize when a filename refers to another
    host (recognizing some syntax like
    <tt>/user@host:/path/to-file</tt>).  Provided you have
    the right access, such an editor can automatically run a
    utility like
    scp(1)
    or
    ftp(1)
    to fetch a local copy, then automatically copy the edited version
    back to the remote location at file-save time.</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>All our case studies can edit plain text.  (The reader should
not take this capability for granted &#8212; there are many things
called editors, such as &#8216;word processors&#8217; that are too
specialized to do this!) We begin seeing variable degrees of optional
complexity in how they handle the more complex tasks.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2963445"/><i>ed</i></h3></div></div><p>ed(1)
is the truly Unix-minimalist way of plain-text editing.  It dates from
the days of teletypes.<sup>[<a id="id2963466" href="#ftn.id2963466">116</a>]</sup>  It has a simple, austere CLI, and there is
no screen display.  In the following listing, computer output is
<span class="emphasis"><em>emphasized</em></span>.</p><pre class="programlisting">

<span class="emphasis"><em>sample.txt: No such file or directory</em></span>

</pre><p>Unbelievable as it may seem to a modern reader, most of Unix's
original code was written with this editor.  The reader with DOS
experience may recognize here the original on which
<i>EDLIN</i> was (crudely) modeled.</p><p>If one defines the job of an editor simply as enabling the user
to create and modify plain text files,
ed(1)
is entirely sufficient for the job.  Importantly to the Unix view of
design correctness, it does nothing else.  Many old-school Unix
programmers half-seriously maintain that all editors with more
features than ed has are simply bloated &#8212; and a few still who
seriously believe this.</p><p>Appropriately, <i>ed</i> was Ken Thompson's
deliberate simplification of the earlier
<i>qed</i>[<a href="apb.html#RitchieQED" title="[RitchieQED]">RitchieQED</a>] editor
&#8212; which was very similar (and the first editor to use regular
expressions in the characteristic Unix way) but had multiple-buffer
capability that Ken deliberately discarded.  He judged it not worth
the additional complexity.</p><p>A notable characteristic of ed(1) and all its descendants is the
object-operation format of its commands (the session example shows an
explicit range on the &#8216;p&#8217; command).  There is a relatively
powerful syntax for specifying line ranges, either numerically, or by
regular-expression pattern match, or by special shorthands for the
current and last line.  Most editor operations can be applied to any
range.  This is a good example of orthogonality.</p><p>Nowadays,
ed(1)
is primarily used as a program-driven editing tool in scripts &#8212;
a role to which editors with more elaborate modes of interactivity are
unsuited.  There is a close variant called
ex(1)
which adds a few useful interactivity features such as command
prompts; it is occasionally useful in rare cases when editing must be
done over a slow serial line, or in certain unusual crash-recovery
situations where the library support needed to run other editors is
not accessible.  For these reasons, every Unix includes an
<i>ed</i> implementation and most include
<i>ex</i> as well.</p><p>The
sed(1)
stream editor mentioned in <a href="generationchapter.html" title="Chapter 9. Generation">Chapter 9</a> is also closely related to ed; many
of the basic commands are the same, though designed to be invoked
through command-line switches rather than from standard input.</p><p>Almost all Unix programmers have strayed from the path of
austerity and minimalist virtue enough to normally use editors that at
least present a roguelike, screen-oriented interface.  However, the
fact that the religion of ed
persists<sup>[<a id="id2963675" href="#ftn.id2963675">117</a>]</sup> says a great deal that is worth
noting about the Unix mindset.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="vi_complexity"/>vi</h3></div></div><a id="id2963706" class="indexterm"/><p>The original
vi(1)
editor was the first attempt to bolt a visual, roguelike interface
onto the command set of
ed(1).
Like ed, its commands are generally single
keystrokes, and it is particularly well suited to use by
touch-typists.</p><p>The original vi didn't have mouse
support, editing menus, macros, assignable key bindings, or any form
of user customization. In line with the religion of ed, vi's partisans
considered the lack of these features a virtue.  On this view, one of
vi's most important virtues is that you can start editing immediately
on a new Unix system without having to carry along your customizations
or worrying that the default command bindings will be dangerously
different from what you're used to.</p><p>One characteristic of vi that
beginners tend to find frustrating is a result of its terse
single-keystroke commands. It has a <i>moded</i>
interface &#8212; you are either in command mode or in text-insertion
mode. In text-insertion mode, the only commands that work are the
ESC key for mode exit and (on newer versions) the cursor-movement
keys. In command mode, typing text will be interpreted as commands and
do odd (and probably destructive) things to your content.</p><p>On the other hand, one property of the command set that
vi fans particularly tout is the
object-operation format it inherited from
ed. Most of the extended commands also
operate in a natural way on any line range.</p><p>Over the years, vi has bulked up
considerably.  Modern versions add mouse support, editing menus,
unlimited undo (the original vi could only
undo the last command), multiple files in separate buffers, and
customization with a run-control file.  However, the use of
run-control files is still unusual, and in contrast to
Emacs, the use of embedded general-purpose
scripting has never caught on.  Instead, vi
implementations have grown individual capabilities to do things, like
syntax awareness of C code and output parsing of C compiler error
messages, by adding C code to vi itself.
Subprocess interaction is not supported.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2963798"/><i>Sam</i></h3></div></div><p>The <i>Sam</i> editor<sup>[<a id="id2963818" href="#ftn.id2963818">118</a>]</sup>
was written by Rob Pike at Bell Labs in the mid-1980s.  Sam was
designed for the Plan 9 operating system<a id="id2963830" class="indexterm"/>, which we'll survey in <a href="futurechapter.html" title="Chapter 20. Futures">Chapter 20</a>.  While the Sam editor is not widely known
outside the Labs, it's favored by many of the original Unix developers
who went on to work on Plan 9, including Ken Thompson himself.</p><p>Sam is a fairly straightforward descendant of ed, remaining much
closer to its parent than vi.  Sam incorporates only two new concepts:
a curses-style text display and text selection with the mouse.</p><p>Each Sam session has exactly one command window, and one or more
text windows.  Text windows edit text, and command windows accept
ed-style editing commands.  The mouse is used to move between windows,
and to select text regions within text windows.  This is a clean,
orthogonal, modeless design that discards most of the interface
complexity of vi.</p><p>Most commands operate by default on a select region that can be
painted with a mouse drag operation.  The select region for a command
can also be set by specifying a line range in the fashion of ed, but
Sam gains considerable power from the fact that the user can select at
finer granularity than a line range.  Because the mouse is available
to do selections and rapidly change focus between buffers (including
the command buffer), Sam needs no equivalent of the default (command)
mode of vi.  The hundreds of extended vi commands are unnecessary and,
therefore, omitted. Overall, Sam adds only about a dozen commands to
the seventeen or so in the ed set, for a total of about thirty.</p><p>Four of the new commands in Sam join two inherited from
ed(1)
and
vi(1),
as ways to apply regular expressions to the task of selecting files
and file regions to operate on.  These provide limited but effective
loop and conditional facilities to the command language.  There is,
however, no way to name or parameterize command-language
procedures. Nor can the language do interactive control of a
subprocess.</p><p>An interesting feature of Sam is that it's split into two parts.
separating a back end that manipulates files and does searches from a
front end that handles the screen interface.  This instance of the 
&#8220;separated engine and interface&#8221; chapter has the 
immediate practical benefit that, though the program has a GUI, it
can run easily over a low-bandwidth connection to edit files on a
remote server.  Also, the front and back ends can be retargeted
relatively easily.</p><p>Sam, like recent versions of vi, has infinite undo.  By design,
it supports neither rich-text editing, nor output parsing, nor
subprocess interaction.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="emacs_editing"/>Emacs</h3></div></div><a id="id2963947" class="indexterm"/><p><i>Emacs</i> is undoubtedly the most
powerful programmer's editor in existence. It's a big, feature-laden
program with a great deal of flexibility and customizability. As we
observed in the <a href="languageschapter.html" title="Chapter 14. Languages">Chapter 14</a>
section on Emacs Lisp, Emacs has an entire programming language inside
it that can be used to write arbitrarily powerful editor
functions.</p><p>Unlike
vi<a id="id2967010" class="indexterm"/>,
Emacs doesn't have interface modes;
instead, commands are normally control characters or prefixed with an
ESC. However, in Emacs it is possible to
bind just about any key sequence to any command, and commands can be
stock or customized Lisp programs.</p><p>Emacs can edit multiple files, each
in a separate buffer, and supports moving text among the buffers.
Versions running under X have native mouse support.</p><p>The Lisp programs bound to Emacs keystrokes can perform
arbitrary text transformations on a buffer.  This capability is
heavily used, among other things to define syntax-aware and rich-text
editing modes for dozens of different languages and markup formats
(beginning with support and color highlighting of C code as in
vi, but going way beyond that).  Each mode
is simply a library file of Lisp code that is loaded on demand.</p><p>Emacs Lisp programs can also interactively control arbitrary
subprocesses.  Some notable consequences of this capability were
listed earlier, including the ability to serve as a front end for
version-control systems, debuggers, and the like.</p><p>The designers of Emacs<sup>[<a id="id2967056" href="#ftn.id2967056">119</a>]</sup> built a programmable editor
that could have task-related intelligence customized into it for
hundreds of different specialized editing jobs.  They then gave it the
ability to drive other tools. As a result, Emacs supports dealing with
all things textual in one shared context &#8212; files, mail, news,
debugger symbols.  It can serve as a customizable front end to any
command with an interactive textual interface.</p><p>It is a common joke, both among fans and detractors of
Emacs, to describe it as an operating
system masquerading as an editor.  That overstates the case, but
Emacs certainly does fulfill the role
occupied by integrated development environments (IDEs) under non-Unix
operating systems (a theme to which we shall return in <a href="toolschapter.html" title="Chapter 15. Tools">Chapter 15</a>).</p><p>This power comes at a price in complexity. To use a customized
Emacs you have to carry around the Lisp
files that define your personal Emacs
preferences. Learning how to customize
Emacs is an entire art in
itself. Emacs is correspondingly harder to
learn than vi.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2967110"/>Wily</h3></div></div><p>The <i>wily</i> editor<sup>[<a id="id2967125" href="#ftn.id2967125">120</a>]</sup>
is a clone of the Plan 9<a id="id2967135" class="indexterm"/> editor
<i>acme</i>.<sup>[<a id="id2967150" href="#ftn.id2967150">121</a>]</sup>
It shares some facilities with Sam, but is intended to provide a
fundamentally different user experience.  Although Wily probably sees
the least widespread use of any of these editors, it is interesting
because it illustrates a different and arguably more Unixy way of
implementing an Emacs-like programmable editor.</p><p>Wily could be described as a minimalist IDE, an implementation
of Emacs-style extensibility without the decades of accompanying
cruft.  In Wily, even global search and replace, that
<span class="foreignphrase"><i>sine qua non</i></span> of Unix editors, is
supplied by an external program.  The built-in commands relate almost
exclusively to windowing operations.  Wily is designed from the ground
up to use the mouse as much, and as well, as possible.</p><p>Wily attempts to replace not only conventional editors but
conventional terminal windows such as
xterm(1)
as well.  In Wily, any piece of text within the main window (which
contains multiple non-overlapping Wily windows) can be an action or a
search expression.  The left mouse button is used to select text, the
middle button to execute text as a command (either built-in or
external), and the right button to search either Wily's buffers or the
file system for text.  No permanent or popup menus are
required.</p><p>In Wily, the keyboard is used <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> to enter
text.  Shortcuts are achieved not by special use of the keyboard, but
by holding down more than one mouse button at the same time.  These
shortcuts are always equivalent to using the middle button on some
built-in command.</p><p>Wily can also be used as the front
end for C, Python, or Perl programs, reporting to them whenever a
window is changed or an execute or search command is performed with
the mouse.  These plugins function analogously to Emacs modes, but
don't run in the same address space with Wily; instead, they
communicate with it via a very simple set of remote procedure calls.
Wily comes packaged with an <i>xterm</i> analog
and a mail tool which uses it as the editing front end.</p><p>Because Wily depends on the mouse so heavily, it cannot be used
on a character-cell-only console display; nor can it be used over a
remote link without X forwarding.  As an editor, Wily is designed for
editing plain text; it has only two fonts (one proportional and one
fixed-width) and has no mechanism that could support rich-text editing
or syntax awareness.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2963466" href="#id2963466">116</a>] </sup>Younger readers may not be aware
