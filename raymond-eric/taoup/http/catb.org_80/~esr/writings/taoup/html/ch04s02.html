is the property that a design can fit inside a human being's head.  A
good practical test for compactness is this: Does an experienced user
normally need a manual?  If not, then the design (or at least the
subset of it that covers normal use) is compact.</p><p>Compact software tools have all the virtues of physical tools
that fit well in the hand.  They feel pleasant to use, they don't obtrude
themselves between your mind and your work, they make you more
productive &#8212; and they are much less likely than unwieldy tools
to turn in your hand and injure you.</p><p>Compact is not equivalent to &#8216;weak&#8217;.  A design can
have a great deal of power and flexibility and still be compact if it
is built on abstractions that are easy to think about and fit together
well.  Nor is compact equivalent to &#8216;easily learned&#8217;; some
compact designs are quite difficult to understand until you have
mastered an underlying conceptual model that is tricky, at which point
your view of the world changes and compact

many are compact in a slightly looser sense of the term.  They have a
compact working set, a subset of capabilities that suffices for 80% or
more of what expert users normally do with them.  Practically
speaking, such designs normally need a reference card or cheat sheet
but not a manual.  We'll call such designs
<i>semi-compact</i>, as opposed to <i>strictly
compact</i>.</p><p>The concept is perhaps best illustrated by examples.  The Unix
system call API is semi-compact, but the standard
C<a id="id2894706" class="indexterm"/> library is not
compact in any sense.  While Unix programmers easily keep a subset of
the system calls sufficient for most applications programming (file
system operations, signals, and process control) in their heads, the C
library on modern Unixes includes many hundreds of entry points,
e.g., mathematical functions, that won't all fit inside a single
programmer's cranium.</p><p><i>The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some
Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information</i> [<a href="apb.html#Miller" title="[Miller]">Miller</a>] is one of the foundation papers in cognitive
psychology (and, incidentally, the specific reason that U.S.
local telephone numbers have seven digits).  It showed that the number
of discrete items of information human beings can hold in
short-term memory is seven, plus or minus two. This gives us a good
rule of thumb for evaluating the compactness of APIs: Does a
programmer have to remember more than seven entry points?  Anything
larger than this is unlikely to be strictly compact.</p><p>Among Unix tools,
make(1)
is compact;
autoconf(1)
and
automake(1)
are not.  Among markup languages, HTML is semi-compact, but DocBook (a
documentation markup language we shall discuss in <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter 18. Documentation">Chapter 18</a>) is not.  The
man(7)
macros are compact, but
troff(1)
markup is not.</p><p>Among general-purpose programming languages,
C<a id="id2894804" class="indexterm"/> and
Python<a id="id2894816" class="indexterm"/> are
semi-compact; 
Perl<a id="id2894824" class="indexterm"/>,
Java<a id="id2894832" class="indexterm"/>, Emacs
Lisp<a id="id2894841" class="indexterm"/>, and
shell<a id="id2894850" class="indexterm"/> are
not (especially since serious shell programming requires you to know
half-a-dozen other tools like
sed(1)
and
awk(1)).
C++<a id="id2894877" class="indexterm"/> is
anti-compact &#8212; the language's designer has admitted that he
doesn't expect any one programmer to ever understand it all.</p><p>Some designs that are not compact have enough internal
redundancy of features that individual programmers end up carving out
compact dialects sufficient for that 80% of common tasks by choosing a
working subset of the language.  Perl has this kind of
pseudo-compactness, for example.  Such designs have a built-in trap;
when two programmers try to communicate about a project, they may find
that differences in their working subsets are a significant barrier to
understanding and modifying the code.</p><p>Noncompact designs are not automatically doomed or bad,
however.  Some problem domains are simply too complex for a compact
design to span them.  Sometimes it's necessary to trade away
compactness for some other virtue, like raw power and range.  Troff
markup is a good example of this.  So is the
BSD<a id="id2894911" class="indexterm"/> sockets
API. The purpose of emphasizing compactness as a virtue is not to
condition you to treat compactness as an absolute requirement, but to
teach you to do what Unix programmers do: value compactness
properly, design for it whenever possible, and not throw it away
casually.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="orthogonality"/>Orthogonality</h3></div></div><a id="id2894936" class="indexterm"/><p>Orthogonality<a id="id2894950" class="indexterm"/>
is one of the most important properties that can help make even
complex designs
compact<a id="id2894960" class="indexterm"/>.  In a purely
orthogonal design, operations do not have side effects; each action
(whether it's an API call, a macro invocation, or a language
operation) changes just one thing without affecting others.  There is
one and only one way to change each property of whatever system you
are controlling.  </p><p>Your monitor has orthogonal controls.  You can change the
brightness independently of the contrast level, and (if the monitor
has one) the color balance control will be independent of both.
Imagine how much more difficult it would be to adjust a monitor on
which the brightness knob affected the color balance: you'd
have to compensate by tweaking the color balance every time after you
changed the brightness.  Worse, imagine if the contrast control also
affected the color balance; then, you'd have to adjust both knobs
simultaneously in exactly the right way to change either contrast or
color balance alone while holding the other constant.</p><p>Far too many software designs are non-orthogonal.  One common
class of design mistake, for example, occurs in code that reads and
parses data from one (source) format to another (target) format.  A
designer who thinks of the source format as always being stored in a
disk file may write the conversion function to open and read from a
named file.  Usually the input could just as well have been any file
handle.  If the conversion routine were designed orthogonally,
e.g., without the side effect of opening a file, it could save work
later when the conversion has to be done on a data stream supplied
from standard input, a network socket, or any other source.</p><p>Doug McIlroy's<a id="id2895012" class="indexterm"/> advice to &#8220;Do one thing well&#8221;
is usually interpreted as being about simplicity.  But it's also,
implicitly and at least as importantly, about orthogonality.</p><p>It's not a problem for a program to do one thing well and
other things as side effects, provided supporting those other things
doesn't raise the complexity of the program and its vulnerability
to bugs.  In <a href="generationchapter.html" title="Chapter 9. Generation">Chapter 9</a> we'll
examine a program called <i>ascii</i> that prints
synonyms for the names of ASCII characters, including hex, octal, and
binary values; as a side effect, it can serve as a quick base
converter for numbers in the range 0&#8211;255.  This second use is not an
orthogonality violation because the features that support it are all
necessary to the primary function; they do not make the program
more difficult to document or maintain.</p><p>The problems with non-orthogonality arise when side effects
complicate a programmer's or user's mental model, and beg to be
forgotten, with results ranging from inconvenient to dire.  Even when
you do not forget the side effects, you're often forced to do extra
work to suppress them or work around them.</p><p>There is an excellent discussion of orthogonality and how to
achieve it in <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> [<a href="apb.html#Hunt-Thomas" title="[Hunt-Thomas]">Hunt-Thomas</a>].  As they point out, orthogonality reduces
test and development time, because it's easier to verify code that
neither causes side effects nor depends on side effects from other
code &#8212; there are fewer combinations to test. If it breaks,
orthogonal code is more easily replaced without disturbance to the
rest of the system.  Finally, orthogonal code is easier to document
and reuse.</p><p>The concept of <i>refactoring</i>, which first
emerged as an explicit idea from the &#8216;Extreme Programming&#8217;
school, is closely related to orthogonality.  To refactor code is to
change its structure and organization without changing its observable
behavior.  Software engineers have been doing this since the birth of
the field, of course, but naming the practice and identifying a stock
set of refactoring techniques has helped concentrate peoples'
thinking in useful ways.  Because these fit so well with the central
concerns of the Unix design tradition, Unix developers have quickly
coopted the terminology and ideas of refactoring.<sup>[<a id="id2895110" href="#ftn.id2895110">43</a>]</sup></p><p>The basic Unix APIs were designed for orthogonality with
imperfect but considerable success.  We take for granted being able to
open a file for write access without exclusive-locking it for write,
for example; not all operating systems are so graceful.  Old-style
(System III<a id="id2895143" class="indexterm"/>)
signals were non-orthogonal, because signal receipt had the
side-effect of resetting the signal handler to the default
die-on-receipt.  There are large non-orthogonal patches like the BSD
sockets<a id="id2895155" class="indexterm"/> API and
<span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> large ones like the X windowing system's
drawing libraries.</p><p>But on the whole the Unix API is a good example:
Otherwise it not only would not but <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> not
be so widely imitated by C<a id="id2895179" class="indexterm"/>
libraries on other operating systems.  This is also a reason that the
Unix API repays study even if you are not a Unix programmer; it has
lessons about orthogonality to teach.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="spot_rule"/>The SPOT Rule</h3></div></div><a id="id2895202" class="indexterm"/><p><i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> articulates a
rule for one particular kind of orthogonality that is especially
important.  Their &#8220;Don't Repeat Yourself&#8221; rule is: every
piece of knowledge must have a <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span>,
unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.  In this
book we prefer, following a suggestion by Brian Kernighan, to call
this the Single Point Of Truth or SPOT rule.</p><p>Repetition leads to inconsistency and code that is subtly
broken, because you changed only some repetitions when you needed to
change <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of them.  Often, it also means
that you haven't properly thought through the organization 
of your code.</p><p>Constants, tables, and metadata should be declared and
initialized <span class="emphasis"><em>once</em></span> and imported elsewhere.  Any
time you see duplicate code, that's a danger sign.  Complexity
is a cost; don't pay it twice.</p><p>Often it's possible to remove code duplication by
<i>refactoring</i>; that is, changing the organization
of your code without changing the core algorithms.  Data duplication
sometimes appears to be forced on you.  But when you see it, here are
some valuable questions to ask:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If you have duplicated data in your code because it has to
have two different representations in two different places, can you
write a function, tool or code generator to make one representation from the
other, or both from a common source?</p></li><li><p>If your documentation duplicates knowledge in your code, can you
generate parts of the documentation from parts of the code, or
vice-versa, or both from a common higher-level representation?
</p></li><li><p>If your header files and interface declarations duplicate
knowledge in your implementation code, is there a way you can generate
the header files and interface declarations from the code?
</p></li></ul></div><p>There is an analog of the SPOT rule for data structures:
&#8220;No junk, no confusion&#8221;.  &#8220;No junk&#8221; says
that the data structure (the model) should be minimal, e.g., not made
so general that it can represent situations which cannot exist.
&#8220;No confusion&#8221; says that states which must be kept
distinct in the real-world problem must be kept distinct in the model.
In short, the SPOT rule advocates seeking a data structure whose
states have a one-to-one correspondence with the states of the
real-world system to be modeled.</p><p>From deeper within the Unix tradition, we can add some of our
own corollaries of the SPOT rule:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Are you duplicating data because you're caching intermediate
results of some computation or lookup?  Consider carefully whether
this is premature
optimization<a id="id2895355" class="indexterm"/>;
stale caches (and the layers of code needed to keep caches
synchronized) are a fertile source of bugs,<sup>[<a id="id2895368" href="#ftn.id2895368">44</a>]</sup> and
can even slow down overall performance if (as often happens) the
cache-management overhead is higher than you expected.</p></li><li><p>If you see lots of duplicative boilerplate code, can you
generate all of it from a single higher-level representation,
twiddling a few knobs to generate the different cases?</p></li></ul></div><p>The reader should begin to see a pattern emerging here.</p><p>In the Unix world, the SPOT Rule as a unifying idea has seldom
been explicit &#8212; but heavy use of code generators to implement
particular <span class="emphasis"><em>kinds</em></span> of SPOT are very much part of the
tradition.  We'll survey these techniques in <a href="generationchapter.html" title="Chapter 9. Generation">Chapter 9</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2895445"/>Compactness and the Strong Single Center</h3></div></div><p>One subtle but powerful way to promote compactness in a

tradition.  Many of its most effective tools are thin wrappers around
a direct translation of some single powerful algorithm.</p><p>Perhaps the clearest example of this is
diff(1),
the Unix tool for reporting differences between related files.  This
tool and its dual,
patch(1),
have become central to the network-distributed development style of
modern Unix.  A valuable property of diff is that it seldom surprises
anyone.  It doesn't have special cases or painful edge conditions,
because it uses a simple, mathematically sound method of sequence
comparison.  This has consequences:</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>By virtue of a mathematical model and a solid

it will do in any given situation without necessarily understanding
the central algorithm perfectly.  Other well-known examples of
this special kind of clarity achieved through a strong central
algorithm abound in Unix:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The
grep(1)
utility for selecting lines out of files by pattern matching is a
simple wrapper around a formal algebra of regular-expression patterns
(see <a href="ch08s02.html#regexps" title="Case Study: Regular Expressions">the section called &#8220;Case Study: Regular Expressions&#8221;</a> for discussion).  If it had
lacked this consistent mathematical model, it would probably look like
the design of the original
glob(1)
facility in the oldest Unixes, a handful of ad-hoc wildcards that
can't be combined.</p></li><li><p>The yacc(1) utility for
generating language parsers is a thin wrapper around the formal theory
of LR(1) grammars. Its partner, the lexical analyzer generator
lex(1),
is a similarly thin wrapper around the theory of nondeterministic
finite-state automata.</p></li></ul></div><p>All three of these programs are so bug-free that their correct
functioning is taken utterly for granted, and compact enough to fit
easily in a programmer's hand. Only a part of these good qualities are due
to the polishing that comes with a long service life and frequent use;
most of it is that, having been constructed around a strong and
provably correct algorithmic core, they never needed much polishing
in the first place.</p><p>The opposite of a formal approach is using
<i>heuristics</i>&#8212;rules of thumb leading
toward a solution that is probabilistically, but not certainly,
correct.  Sometimes we use heuristics because a deterministically
correct solution is impossible. Think of spam filtering, for example;
an algorithmically perfect spam filter would need a full solution to
the problem of understanding natural language as a module.  Other
times, we use heuristics because known formally correct methods are
impossibly expensive.  Virtual-memory management is an example of
this; there are near-perfect solutions, but they require so much
runtime instrumentation that their overhead would swamp any
theoretical gain over heuristics.</p><p>The trouble with heuristics is that they proliferate special
cases and edge cases.  If nothing else, you usually have to backstop 
a heuristic with some sort of recovery mechanism when it fails.  All
the usual problems with escalating complexity follow.  To manage the
resulting tradeoffs, you have to start by being aware of them.  Always
ask if a heuristic actually pays off in performance what it costs 
in code complexity &#8212; and don't guess at the performance
difference, actually measure it before making a decision.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2899405"/>The Value of Detachment</h3></div></div><p>We began this book with a reference to Zen: &#8220;a special
transmission, outside the scriptures&#8221;.  This was not mere
exoticism for stylistic effect; the core concepts of Unix have always
had a spare, Zen-like simplicity that continues to shine through the
layers of historical accidents that have accreted around
them<a id="id2899424" class="indexterm"/>.  This
quality is reflected in the cornerstone documents of Unix, like
<i>The C Programming Language</i> [<a href="apb.html#Kernighan-Ritchie" title="[Kernighan-Ritchie]">Kernighan-Ritchie</a>] and the 1974 CACM paper that introduced
Unix to the world; one of the famous quotes from that paper observes
&#8220;...constraint has encouraged not only economy, but also a
certain elegance of design&#8221;.  That simplicity came from trying
to think not about how much a language or operating system could do,
but of how <span class="emphasis"><em>little</em></span> it could do &#8212; not by
carrying assumptions but by starting from zero (what in Zen is called
&#8220;beginner's mind&#8221; or &#8220;empty mind&#8221;).</p><p>To design for
compactness<a id="id2899472" class="indexterm"/> and
orthogonality<a id="id2899480" class="indexterm"/>,
start from zero.  Zen teaches that attachment leads to suffering;
experience with software design teaches that attachment to unnoticed
assumptions leads to non-orthogonality, noncompact designs, and
projects that fail or become maintenance nightmares.</p><p>To achieve enlightenment and surcease from suffering, Zen
teaches detachment.  The Unix tradition teaches the value of
detachment from the particular, accidental conditions under which a
design problem was posed.  Abstract.  Simplify.  Generalize.  Because
we write software to solve problems, we cannot completely detach from
the problems &#8212; but it is well worth the mental effort to see how
many preconceptions you can throw away, and whether the design becomes
more compact<a id="id2899507" class="indexterm"/> and
orthogonal as you do that.  Possibilities for code reuse often
result.</p><p>Jokes about the relationship between Unix and Zen are a live
