Get&#8221; (WYSIWYG) documentation programs and
<i>markup-centered tools</i>. Most desktop-publishing
programs and word processors are in the former category; they have
GUIs in which what one types is inserted directly into an on-screen
presentation of the document intended to resemble the final printed
version as closely as possible.  In a markup-centered system, by
contrast, the master document is normally flat text containing
explicit, visible control tags and not at all resembling the intended
output.  The marked-up source can be modified with an ordinary text
editor, but has to be fed to a formatter program to produce rendered
output for printing or display.</p><p>The visual-interface, WYSIWYG style was too expensive for early
computer hardware, and remained rare until the advent of the Macintosh
personal computer in 1984. It is completely dominant on non-Unix
operating systems today, Native Unix document tools, on the other
hand, are almost all markup-centered. The Unix
troff(1)
of 1971 was a markup formatter, and is probably the oldest such
program still in use.  </p><p>Markup-centered tools still have a role because actual
implementations of WYSIWYG tend to be broken in various ways &#8212;
some superficial, some deep.  WYSIWYG document processors have the
general problem with GUIs that we discussed in <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter 11. Interfaces">Chapter 11</a>; the fact that you
<span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> visually manipulate anything tends to mean
you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> visually manipulate everything.  That
would remain a problem even if the WYSIWIG correspondence between
screen and printer output were perfect &#8212; but it almost never
is.</p><p>In truth, WYSIWYG document processors aren't exactly
WYSIWIG. Most have interfaces that obscure the differences between
screen presentation and printer output without actually eliminating
them. Thus they violate the Rule of Least Surprise: the visual aspect
of the interface encourages you to use the program like a
typewriter even though it is not, and your input will occasionally
produce an unexpected and undesired result.</p><p>In further truth, WYSIWIG systems actually rely on markup codes
but expend great effort on keeping them invisible in normal use.  Thus they
break the Rule of Transparency: you can't see all of the markup, so it
is difficult to fix documents that break because of misplaced markup
codes. </p><p>Despite its problems, WYSIWYG document processors can be very
nice if what you want is to slide a picture three ems to the right on
the cover of a four-page brochure.  But they tend to be constricting
any time you need to make a global change to the layout of a 300-page
manuscript. WYSIWYG users faced with that kind of challenge must give
it up or suffer the death of a thousand mouse clicks; in situations
like that, there is really no substitute for being able to edit
explicit markup, and Unix's markup-centered document tools offer
better solutions.</p><p>Today, in a world influenced by the example of the Web and XML,
it has become common to make a distinction between
<i>presentation</i> and
<i>structural</i> markup in documents &#8212; the
former being instructions about how a document should look, the latter
being instructions about how it's organized and what it means.
This distinction wasn't clearly understood or followed through in
early Unix tools, but it's important for understanding the design
pressures that led to today's descendants of them.</p><p>Presentation-level markup carries all the formatting information
(e.g., about desired whitespace layout and font changes) in the
document itself.  In a structural-markup system, the document has to
be combined with a <i>stylesheet</i> that tells  the
formatter how to translate the structure markup in the document to a
physical layout.  Both kinds of markup ultimately control the physical
appearance of a printed or browsed document, but structural markup
does it through one more level of indirection that turns out to be
necessary if you want to produce good results for both printing 
and the Web.</p><p>Most markup-centered documentation systems support a macro
facility.  Macros are user-defined commands that are expanded by text
substitution into sequences of built-in markup requests.  Usually,
these macros add structural features (like the ability to declare
section headings) to the markup language.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>The troff macro sets (<i>mm</i>,
<i>me</i>, and my <i>ms</i> package) were actually designed to push
people away from format-oriented editing and toward content-oriented
editing.  The idea was to label the semantic parts and then have
different style packages that would know whether in this style the
title should be boldfaced or not, centered or not, and so on.  Thus
there was at one point a set of macros that tried to imitate ACM
style, and another that imitated Physical Review style, but used the
basic <tt>-ms</tt> markup.  All of the macros lost out to
people who were focused on producing one document, and controlling its
appearance, just as Web pages get bogged down in the dispute over
whether the reader or author should control the appearance.  I
frequently found secretaries who were using the .AU
(author name) command just to produce italics, noticing that it did
that, and then getting into trouble with its other effects.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

the sorts of things composers want to do with small documents
(business and personal letters, brochures, newsletters) and the things
they want to do with large ones (books, long articles, technical
papers, and manuals).  Large documents tend to have more structure, to
be pieced together from parts that may have to be changed separately,
and to need automatically-generated features like tables of contents;
these are both traits that favor markup-centered tools.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="documentationchapter.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="documentationchapter.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch18s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 18. Documentation </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Unix Style</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
