apply every tactic for keeping your code simple, and also concentrate
on the ways in which your code is a communication to other human
beings.  The first questions to ask, after &#8220;Will this design
work?&#8221; are &#8220;Will it be readable to other people?  Is it
elegant?&#8221; We hope it is clear by now that these questions are
not fluff and that elegance is not a luxury.  These qualities in the
human reaction to software are essential for reducing its bugginess
and increasing its long-term maintainability.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="zen_of_transparency"/>The Zen of Transparency</h3></div></div><a id="id2914354" class="indexterm"/><p>One
pattern that emerges from the examples we've examined so far in this
chapter is this: If you want transparent code, the most effective
route is simply not to layer too much abstraction over what you
are manipulating with the code.</p><p>In <a href="modularitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#160;4.&#160;Modularity">Chapter&#160;4</a>'s
section on the value of detachment, our advice was to abstract and
simplify and generalize, to try and detach from the particular,
accidental conditions under which a design problem was posed.  The
advice to abstract does not actually contradict the advice against
excessive abstractions we're developing here, because there is a
difference between getting free of assumptions and forgetting the
problem you're trying to solve.  This is part of what we were driving
at when we developed the idea that glue layers need to be kept
thin.</p><p>One of the main lessons of Zen is that we ordinarily see the
world through a haze of preconceptions and fixed ideas that proceed
from our desires.  To achieve enlightenment, we must follow the Zen
teaching not merely to let go of desire and attachment, but to
experience reality exactly as it is &#8212; without the preconceptions
and the fixed ideas getting in the way.</p><p>This is excellent pragmatic advice for software designers.  It's
part of what's implicit in the classic Unix advice to be minimalist.
Software designers are clever people who form ideas (abstractions)
about the application domains they deal with.  They organize the
software they write around those ideas.  Then, when debugging, they
often find they have great trouble seeing through those ideas to what
is actually going on.</p><p>Any Zen master would recognize this problem instantly, yell
&#8220;Three pounds of flax!&#8221;, and probably clout the student a
good one.<sup>[<a id="id2914429" href="#ftn.id2914429">63</a>]</sup>  Consciously
designing for transparency is a slightly less mystical way of
addressing it.</p><p>In <a href="modularitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#160;4.&#160;Modularity">Chapter&#160;4</a> we
criticized object-oriented programming in terms likely to prove a bit
shocking to programmers who were raised on the 1990s gospel of
OO<a id="id2914465" class="indexterm"/>. Object-oriented design doesn't have
to be over-complicated design, but we've observed that too often it
is.  Too many OO designs are spaghetti-like tangles of is-a and has-a
relationships, or feature thick layers of glue in which many of the
objects seem to exist simply to hold places in a steep-sided pyramid
of abstractions.  Such designs are the opposite of transparent; they
are (notoriously) opaque and difficult to debug.</p><p>As we've previously noted, Unix programmers are the original
zealots about modularity, but tend to go about it in a quieter way.
Keeping glue layers thin is part of it; more generally, our tradition
teaches us to build lower, hugging the ground with algorithms and
structures that are designed to be simple and transparent.</p><p>As with Zen art, the simplicity of good Unix code depends on
exacting self-discipline and a high level of craft, neither of which
are necessarily apparent on casual inspection.  Transparency is hard
work, but worth the effort for more than merely artistic reasons.
Unlike Zen art, software requires debugging &#8212; and usually needs
continuing maintenance, forward-porting, and adaptation throughout
its lifetime.  Transparency is therefore more than an esthetic
triumph; it is a victory that will be reflected in lower costs
throughout the software's life cycle.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2914509"/>Coding for Transparency and Discoverability</h3></div></div><p>Transparency and
discoverability<a id="id2914519" class="indexterm"/>,
like modularity, are primarily properties of designs, not code.  It is
not sufficient to get right the low-level elements of style, such as
indenting code in a clear and consistent way or having good
variable-naming conventions.  These qualities have much more to do
with code properties that are less obvious to inspection.  Here are a
few to think about:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>What is the maximum static depth of your procedure-call
hierarchy?  That is, leaving out recursions, how many levels of call
might a human have to model mentally to understand the operation of
the code?  Hint: If it's more than four, beware.</p></li><li><p>Does the code have invariant properties<sup>[<a id="id2914557" href="#ftn.id2914557">64</a>]</sup> that are both strong and visible?  Invariant
properties help human beings reason about code and detect problem
cases.</p></li><li><p>Are the function calls in your APIs individually orthogonal, or
do they have too many magic flags and mode bits that have a single call doing
multiple tasks?  Avoiding mode flags entirely can lead to a cluttered
API with too many nigh-identical functions, but the obverse error (lots of
easily-forgotten and confusable mode flags) is even more common.</p></li><li><p>Are there a handful of prominent data structures or a single
global scoreboard that captures the high-level state of the system?
Is this state easy to visualize and inspect, or is it diffused among
many individual global variables or objects that are hard to
find?</p></li><li><p>Is there a clean, one-to-one mapping between data structures
or classes in your program and the entities in the world that they 
represent?</p></li><li><p>Is it easy to find the portion of the code responsible for any
given function? How much attention have you paid to the readability
not just of individual functions and modules but of the whole codebase?</p></li><li><p>Does the code proliferate special cases or avoid them?  Every
special case could interact with every other special case; all those
potential collisions are bugs waiting to happen. But even more
importantly, special cases make the code harder to understand.</p></li><li><p>How many magic numbers (unexplained constants) does the code have in
it?  Is it easy to discover the implementation's limits (such as
critical buffer sizes) by inspection?</p></li></ul></div><p>It's best for code to be simple.  But if it answers these sorts
of questions well, it can be very complex without putting an
impossible cognitive burden on a human maintainer.</p><p>The reader might find it instructive to compare these with our
checklist questions about modularity in <a href="modularitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#160;4.&#160;Modularity">Chapter&#160;4</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2914680"/>Transparency and Avoiding Overprotectiveness</h3></div></div><p>Close kin to the programmer tendency to build overelaborate
castles of abstractions is a tendency to overprotect others from the
low-level details.  While it's not bad practice to hide those details
in the program's normal mode of operation
(<i>fetchmail</i>'s <tt>-v</tt> switch is
off by default), they should be discoverable.  There's an important
difference between hiding them and making them inaccessible.</p><p>Programs that <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> reveal what they are
doing make troubleshooting far more difficult. Thus, experienced Unix
users actually take the presence of debugging and instrumentation
switches as a good sign, and their absence as possibly a bad one.
Absence suggests an inexperienced or careless developer; presence
suggests one with enough wisdom to follow the Rule of
Transparency.</p><p>The temptation to overprotect is especially strong in GUI
applications targeted for end users, like mail readers.  One reason 
Unix developers have been cool toward GUI interfaces is that, in
their designers' haste to make them &#8216;user-friendly&#8217; each one
often becomes frustratingly opaque to anyone who has to solve user problems
&#8212; or, indeed, interact with it anywhere outside the narrow
range predicted by the user-interface designer.</p><p>Worse, programs that are opaque about what they are doing tend
to have a lot of assumptions baked into them, and to be frustrating or
brittle or both in any use case not anticipated by the designer.
Tools that look glossy but shatter under stress are not good long-term
value.</p><p>Unix tradition pushes for programs that are flexible for a 
broader range of uses and troubleshooting situations, including the
ability to present as much state and activity information to the user
as the user indicates he is willing to handle.  This is good for
troubleshooting; it is also good for growing smarter, more
self-reliant users.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2914758"/>Transparency and Editable Representations</h3></div></div><p>Another theme that emerges from these examples is the value of
programs that flip a problem out of a domain in which transparency is
hard into one in which it is easy.  Audacity,
sng(1)
and the
tic(1)/infocmp(1)
pair all have this property.  The objects they manipulate are not
readily conformable to the hand and eye; audio files are not visual
objects, and although images expressed in
PNG<a id="id2914799" class="indexterm"/> format are visual,
the complexities of PNG annotation chunks are not.  All three
applications turn manipulation of their binary file formats into a
problem to which human beings can more readily apply intuition and
competences gained from everyday experience.</p><p>A rule all these examples follow is that they degrade the
representation as little as possible &#8212; in fact, they translate
it reversibly and losslessly.  This property is very important, and
worth implementing even if there is no obvious application demand for
that kind of 100% fidelity.  It gives potential users confidence that
they can experiment without degrading their data.</p><p>All the advantages of textual data-file formats that we
discussed in <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#160;5.&#160;Textuality">Chapter&#160;5</a>
also apply to the textual formats that
sng(1),
infocmp(1)
and their kin generate.  One important application for
sng(1)
is robotic generation of
PNG<a id="id2914865" class="indexterm"/> image annotations by
scripts &#8212; because
sng(1)
exists, such scripts are easier to write.</p><p>Whenever you face a design problem that involves editing some
kind of complex binary object, the Unix tradition encourages asking
first off whether you can write a tool analogous to
sng(1)
or the
tic(1)/infocmp(1)
pair that can do a lossless mapping to an editable textual format and
back. There is no established term for programs of this kind, but
we'll call them <i>textualizers</i>.</p><p>If the binary object is dynamically generated or very large,
then it may not be practical or possible to capture all the state with
a textualizer.  In that case, the equivalent task is to write a
browser. The paradigm example is
fsdb(1),
the file-system debugger supported under various Unixes; there is a
Linux equivalent called
debugfs(1).
The
psql(1)
used to browse PostgreSQL databases, and the
smbclient(1)
program that can be used to query Windows file shares on a
SAMBA-equipped Linux machine, are two more.  All five are simple CLI
programs that could be driven by scripts and test harnesses.</p><p>Writing a textualizer or browser is a valuable exercise for at
least four reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>You gain an excellent learning experience.</em></span>
There may be other ways that are as good to learn about the structure
of the object, but none that are obviously better.
</p></li><li><p> 
<span class="emphasis"><em>You gain the ability to dump the contents of the structure for
inspection and debugging.</em></span> Because such a tool makes dumping
easy, you'll do it more. You'll get more information, probably leading
to more insight.
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>You gain the ability to easily generate test loads and unusual 
cases.</em></span>  This means you are more likely to probe the
odd corners of the object's state space &#8212; and to break the
associated software, so you can fix it before your users break it.
</p></li><li><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>You gain code you may be able to reuse.</em></span> If you're
careful about how you write the browser/textualizer and keep the CLI
interpreter properly separated from the marshaling/unmarshaling library,
you may find you have code that can be reused for your actual
application.
</p></li></ul></div><p>After you've done this, you may well discover that it's possible
to apply the &#8220;separated engine and interface&#8221; pattern
(see <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter&#160;11.&#160;Interfaces">Chapter&#160;11</a>) using
your textualizer/debugger as the engine.  All the usual benefits of
this pattern will apply.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#160;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>It is desirable, although often difficult, for a textualizer to
be able to read and write even a damaged binary object.  For one
thing, it lets you generate damaged test cases to stress-test
software; for another, it can make emergency repairs a whole lot

<span class="emphasis"><em>structure</em></span> of the object is messed up, but at
least you should handle cases in which the <span class="emphasis"><em>content</em></span>

debugging, is that transparent systems are easier to perform recovery
actions on after a bug bites &#8212; and, often, more resistant to
damage from bugs in the first place.</p><p>In comparing the terminfo database with Windows registries
we noted that registries are notoriously subject to being corrupted
by buggy application code.  This can make the entire system unusable.  
Even if it doesn't, recovery can be difficult if the corruption
confuses the specialized registry-editing tools.</p><p>Our Unix case studies illustrate ways that designing for
transparency can prevent this class of problem.  Because the terminfo
database is not one big file, botching one terminfo entry does not
make the whole terminfo data set unusable.  Fully textual one-big-file
formats like termcap are usually parsed with methods which (unlike
block reads of binary structure dumps) can recover from single-point
errors.  Syntax errors in an SNG file can be corrected by hand without
requiring specialized editors that might refuse to load a damaged PNG
image.</p><p>Going back to the <i>kmail</i> case study,
that program makes fault diagnosis easier because it obeys the Rule of
Repair: SMTP failures are noisy, usefully so.
You don't have to decode a layer of obfuscatory messages
generated by <i>kmail</i> itself to see
what the interaction with the SMTP server looks like.  All you have to
do is look in the right place, because
<i>kmail</i> is being transparent and not throwing
away information about the error state.  (It helps that SMTP itself is
textual and includes human-readable status messages in its
transactions.)</p><p>Discoverability tools like textualizers and browsers also make
fault diagnosis easier.  We've already touched on one reason: they
make inspecting the state of the system easier.  But there is another
effect at work as well; textualized versions of data tend to have
useful redundancies (such as using whitespace for visual separation as
well as explicit delimiters for parsing). These are present to make
them easier to read for humans, but also have the effect of making them
more resistant to being irreparably trashed by point failures.  A
corrupted chunk in a PNG file is seldom recoverable, but the human
capacity for pattern recognition and reasoning from context might be
able to repair the equivalent SNG form.</p><p>Over and over again, the Rule of Robustness is clear.
Simplicity plus transparency lowers costs, reduces everybody's stress,
and frees people to concentrate on new problems rather than cleaning
up after old mistakes.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2914429" href="#id2914429">63</a>] </sup>See the koan called <i>Tozan's Three
