environment variables, and at command-line arguments. Observe the
progression from least easily changed to most easily changed. There is
a strong convention that well-behaved Unix programs that use more than
one of these places should look at them in the order given, allowing
later settings to override earlier ones (there are specific
exceptions, such as command-line options that specify where a dotfile
should be found).</p><p>In particular, environment settings usually override dotfile
settings, but can be overridden by command-line options. It is good
practice to provide a command-line option like the <tt>-e</tt>
of
make(1) 
that can override environment settings or declarations in run-control files;
that way the program can be scripted with well-defined behavior
regardless of the way the run-control files look or environment
variables are set.</p><p>Which of these places you choose to look at depends on how much
persistent configuration state your program needs to keep around
between invocations. Programs designed mainly to be used in a batch
mode (as generators or filters in pipelines, for example) are usually
completely configured with command-line options. Good examples of this
pattern include
ls(1),
grep(1)
and
sort(1). At
the other extreme, large programs with complicated interactive
behavior may rely entirely on run-control files and environment
variables, and normal use involves few command-line options or none at
all. Most X window managers are a good example of this pattern.</p><p>(Unix has the capability for the same file to have multiple
names or &#8216;links&#8217;.  At startup time, every program has
available to it the filename through which it was called.
One other way to signal to a program that has several modes of
operation which one it should come up in is to give it a link for each
mode, have it find out which link it was called through, and change 
its behavior accordingly.  But this technique is generally considered
unclean and seldom used.)</p><p>Let's look at a couple of programs that gather configuration
data from all three places. It will be instructive to consider why,
for each given piece of configuration data, it is collected as it
is.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="fetchmail_environment"/>Case Study:
<i>fetchmail</i></h3></div></div><a id="id2950315" class="indexterm"/><p>The <i>fetchmail</i> program uses only two
environment variables, <tt>USER</tt> and
<tt>HOME</tt>. These variables are in the predefined set
initialized by the system; many programs use them.</p><p>The value of <tt>HOME</tt> is used to find the dotfile
<tt>.fetchmailrc</tt>, which contains configuration
information in a fairly elaborate syntax obeying the shell-like
lexical rules described above. This is appropriate because, once it
has been initially set up, Fetchmail's
configuration will change only infrequently.</p><p>There is neither an <tt>/etc/fetchmailrc</tt> nor
any other systemwide file specific to fetchmail. Normally such files
hold configuration that's not specific to an individual user.
fetchmail does use a small set of properties with this kind of scope
&#8212; specifically, the name of the local postmaster, and a few
switches and values describing the local mail transport setup (such as
the port number of the local SMTP listener). In practice, however,
these are seldom changed from their compiled-in default values.  When
they are changed, they tend to be modified in user-specific
ways. Thus, there has been no demand for a systemwide fetchmail 
run-control file.</p><p>Fetchmail can retrieve host/login/password triples from a
<tt>.netrc</tt> file. Thus, it gets authenticator
information in the least surprising way.</p><p>Fetchmail has an elaborate set of command-line options, which
nearly but do not entirely replicate what the
<tt>.fetchmailrc</tt> can express. The set was not
originally large, but grew over time as new constructs were added to
the <tt>.fetchmailrc</tt> minilanguage and parallel
command-line options for them were added more or less
reflexively.</p><p>The intent of supporting all these options was to make
fetchmail easier to script by allowing
users to override bits of its run control from the command line. But
it turns out that outside of a few options like
<tt>--fetchall</tt> and <tt>--verbose</tt> there is
little demand for this &#8212; and none that can't be satisfied with a
shellscript that creates a temporary run-control file on the fly and
then feeds it to fetchmail using the
<tt>-f</tt> option.</p><p>Thus, most of the command-line options are never used, and in
retrospect including them was probably a mistake; they bulk up the
fetchmail code a bit without accomplishing
anything very useful.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>If bulking up the code were the only problem, nobody would care,
except for a couple of maintainers.  However, options increase the

doesn't clutter up either the code or the manual much, is to have a
&#8220;set option variable&#8221; option, such as the
<tt>-O</tt> option of <i>sendmail</i>,
which lets you specify an option name and value, and sets that name to
that value as if such a setting had been given in a configuration
file.  A more powerful variant of this is what
<i>ssh</i> does with its <tt>-o</tt>
option: the argument to <tt>-o</tt> is treated as if it were a
line appended to the configuration file, with the full config-file
syntax available.  Either of these approaches gives people with
unusual requirements a way to override configuration from the command
line, without requiring you to provide a separate option for each bit
of configuration that might be overridden.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

displays on Unix machines. Unix applications running through a client machine
with a bitmapped display get their input events through X and 
send screen-painting requests to it.  Confusingly, X &#8216;servers&#8217;
actually run on the client machine &#8212; they exist to serve requests to
interact with the client machine's display device.  The applications
sending those requests to the X server are called &#8216;X
clients&#8217;, even though they may be running on a server machine.
And no, there is no way to explain this inverted terminology that is
not confusing.</p><p>X servers have a forbiddingly complex interface to their
environment. This is not surprising, as they have to deal with a wide
range of complex hardware and user preferences. The environment
queries common to all X servers, documented on the
X(1)
and
Xserver(1)
pages, therefore make a useful example for study.  The implementation
we examine here is XFree86, the X implementation used under
Linux<a id="id2950627" class="indexterm"/>
and several other open-source Unixes.</p><p>At startup, the XFree86 server examines a systemwide
run-control file; the exact pathname varies between X builds on
different platforms, but the basename is XF86Config. The XF86Config
file has a shell-like syntax as described above. <a href="#X_config" title="Example 10.2. X configuration example.">Example 10.2</a> is a sample section of an XF86Config file.</p><div class="example"><a id="X_config"/><p class="title"><b>Example 10.2. X configuration example.</b></p><pre class="programlisting">

</pre></div><p>The XF86Config file describes the host machine's display
hardware (graphics card, monitor), keyboard, and pointing device
(mouse/trackball/glidepad). It's appropriate for this information to
live in a systemwide run-control file, because it applies to all
users of the machine.</p><p>Once X has acquired its hardware configuration from the run
control file, it uses the value of the environment variable
<tt>HOME</tt> to find two dotfiles in the calling user's home
directory. These files are <tt>.Xdefaults</tt> and
<tt>.xinitrc</tt>.<sup>[<a id="id2950710" href="#ftn.id2950710">105</a>]</sup></p><p>The <tt>.Xdefaults</tt> file specifies per-user,
application-specific resources relevant to X (trivial examples of
these might include font and foreground/background colors for a
terminal emulator). The phrase &#8216;relevant to X&#8217; indicates a
design problem, however.  Collecting all these resource declarations
in one place is convenient for inspecting and editing them, but it is
not always clear what should be declared in
<tt>.Xdefaults</tt> and what belongs in an
application-specific dotfile. The <tt>.xinitrc</tt> file
specifies the commands that should be run to initialize the user's X
desktop just after server startup. These programs will almost always
include a window or session manager.</p><p>X servers have a large set of command-line options. Some of
these, such as the <tt>-fp</tt> (font path) option, override
the XF86Config.  Some are intended to help track server bugs, such as
the <tt>-audit</tt> option; if these are used at all, they are
likely to vary quite frequently between test runs and are therefore
poor candidates to be included in a run-control file. A very important
option is the one that sets the server's display number. Multiple
servers may run on a host provided each has a unique display number,
but all instances share the same run-control file(s); thus, the
display number cannot be derived solely from those files.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2950710" href="#id2950710">105</a>] </sup>The
