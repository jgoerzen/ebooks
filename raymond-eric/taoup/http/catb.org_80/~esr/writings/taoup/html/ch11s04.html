the demise of teletypes for two reasons. One is that command-line and
command-language interfaces are more expressive than visual
interfaces, especially for complex tasks. The other is that CLI
interfaces are highly scriptable &#8212; they readily support the
combining of programs, as we discussed in detail in <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter 7. Multiprogramming">Chapter 7</a>.  Usually (though not always) CLIs
have an advantage in concision as well.</p><p>The disadvantage of the CLI style, of course, is that it almost
always has high mnemonic load (low ease), and usually has low
transparency<a id="id2951348" class="indexterm"/>. Most people (especially
non-technical end users) find such interfaces relatively cryptic and
difficult to learn.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>On the other hand, the &#8216;user-friendly&#8217; GUIs of other

burdensome as any Unix command line interface, save that one can in
theory find the treasure by sufficient exploration.  In Unix, one
needs the manual.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

which pushing buttons is not just burdensome but extremely limiting.
Neither keystroke commands to a full-screen character interface nor
GUI gestures on a graphic display can express typical actions in
the problem domain as expressively or concisely as typing SQL
direct to a server. And it is certainly easier to make a client
program utter SQL queries than it would be to have it simulate a
user clicking a GUI!</p><p>On the other hand, many non-technical database users are so
resistant to having to remember SQL syntax that they prefer a less
concise and less expressive full-screen or GUI interface.</p><p>SQL is a good example for illustrating another point.  The most
powerful CLIs are not ad-hoc collections of commands, but imperative
minilanguages designed along the lines we described in <a href="minilanguageschapter.html" title="Chapter 8. Minilanguages">Chapter 8</a>. These minilanguages are the
highest-power, highest-complexity end of the CLI spectrum; they
maximize expressiveness, but minimize ease.  They are difficult to use
and generally need to be discreetly veiled from ordinary end-users,
but unbeatable when the capability and flexibility of the interface is
the most important thing.  When properly designed, they also score
high on scriptability.</p><p>Some applications, unlike database queries, are naturally
visual. Paint programs, Web browsers, and presentation software make
three excellent examples. What these application domains have in common
is that (a) transparency is extremely valuable, and (b) the primitive
actions in the problem domain are themselves visual: &#8220;draw
this&#8221;, &#8220;show me what I'm pointing at&#8221;, &#8220;put
this here&#8221;.</p><p>The flip side of paint programs is that it is
difficult to capture relationships within the pictures they are 
manipulating. It takes careful, thoughtful design to give the user any
handle on the structure of images with repeated elements, for
example. This is a general design problem with visual interfaces.</p><p>In <a href="transparencychapter.html" title="Chapter 6. Transparency">Chapter 6</a> we
looked at the Audacity sound file editor.  Its interface design
succeeds because it does a particularly clean job of mapping its audio
application domain onto a simple set of visual representations
(borrowed from equalizer displays on stereos).  It does this by
thoroughly following through the consequences of a single translation:
sounds to waveform images.  The visual operations are not a mere
grab-bag of low-level tweaks; they are all tied to that
translation.</p><p>In applications that are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> naturally
visual, however, visual interfaces are most appropriate for simple
one-shot or infrequent tasks performed by novice users (a point the
database example illustrates).  </p><p>Resistance to CLI interfaces tends to decrease as users become
more expert. In many problem domains, users (especially
<span class="emphasis"><em>frequent</em></span> users) reach a crossover point at which
the concision and expressiveness of CLI becomes more valuable than
avoiding its mnemonic load. Thus, for example, computing novices
prefer the ease of GUI desktops, but experienced users often gradually
discover that they prefer typing commands to a shell.</p><p>CLIs also tend to gain utility as problems scale up and involve
more in the way of canned, procedural and repetitive actions. Thus,
for example, a WYSIWYG desktop-publishing program is usually the
easiest route to composing relatively small and unstructured documents
such as business letters. But for complex book-sized documents that
are assembled from sections and may require many global format changes
or structural manipulation during composition, a minilanguage
formatter such as <i>troff</i>,
<i>Tex</i>, or some XML-markup
processor<a id="id2951536" class="indexterm"/> is usually a
more effective choice (see <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter 18. Documentation">Chapter 18</a> for more discussion of this
tradeoff).</p><p>Even in domains that are naturally visual, scaling up the
problem size tends to tilt the tradeoff toward a CLI. If you need to
fetch and save one Web page from a given URL, point and click (or type
and click) is fine.  But for Web forms, you're going to use a
keyboard.  And if you need to fetch and save the pages corresponding
to a given list of fifty URLs, a CLI client that can read URLs from
standard input or the command line can save you a lot of unnecessary
motion.</p><p>As another example, consider modifying the color table in a
graphic image. If you want to change one color (say, to lighten it by
an amount you will only know is right when you see it) a visual
dialogue with a color-picker widget is almost mandatory. But suppose
you need to replace the entire table with a set of specified RGB
values, or to create and index large numbers of thumbnails. These are
operations that GUIs usually lack the expressive power to
specify. Even when they do, invoking a properly designed CLI or filter
program will do the job far more concisely.</p><p>Finally (as we observed earlier on) CLIs are important in 
facilitating using programs from other programs. A GUI graphics
editor that <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> handle making a batch of
thumbnails for a list of files probably does it with a plugin written
in a scripting language, calling an internal CLI of the graphics
editor (as in the GIMP's<a id="id2951596" class="indexterm"/>
script-fu facility). Unix environments bring the value of CLIs into
sharper relief precisely because their IPC facilities are rich, have
low overhead, and are easily accessible from user programs.</p><p>The explosion of interest in GUIs since 1984 has had the
unfortunate effect of obscuring the virtues of CLIs. The design of
consumer software, in particular, has become heavily skewed toward
GUIs. While this is a good choice for the novice and casual users that
constitute most of the consumer market, it also exacts hidden costs on
more expert users as they run up against the expressiveness limits of
GUIs &#8212; costs which steadily increase as the users take on more
demanding problems. Most of these costs derive from the fact that GUIs
are simply not scriptable at all &#8212; <span class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span>
interaction with them has to be human-driven.</p><p>Gentner &amp; Nielsen sum up the tradeoff very well in
<i>The Anti-Mac Interface</i> [<a href="apb.html#Gentner-Nielsen" title="[Gentner-Nielsen]">Gentner-Nielsen</a>]: &#8220;[Visual interfaces] work well for
simple actions with a small number of objects, but as the number of
actions or objects increases, direct manipulation quickly becomes
repetitive drudgery.  The dark side of a direct manipulation interface
is that you have to manipulate everything. Instead of an executive who
gives high-level instructions, the user is reduced to an assembly-line
worker who must carry out the same task over and over&#8221;. Noted
science-fiction writer Neal Stephenson made the same point, less
directly but more entertainingly, in his brilliant and discursive
essay <i>In the Beginning Was the Command Line</i>
[<a href="apb.html#Stephenson" title="[Stephenson]">Stephenson</a>].</p><p>A typical Unix old hand's take on this problem is rather less
theoretical:</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>The commercial world generally goes for the novice mode because 
(a) purchase decisions are often made on the basis of 30 seconds trial, 
and (b) it minimizes the demands on customer support to have only a 
dumbed-down GUI.  I find many non-Unix systems very frustrating because,
for example, they will provide no way to do something on a hundred or a
thousand files; I want to write a script, and there's no support for it.  The
basic problem is that they've assumed all users are novices all the
time, and then they bash Unix because it doesn't cater to that model.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

users, for cooperating with other computer programs, and whether
the problem domain is naturally visual or not &#8212; support for
<span class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> CLI and visual interfaces is important. Unix's
history positions it well to meet both sets of needs. After
presenting an indicative case study, we will examine the
characteristic design patterns that the Unix tradition has evolved
to meet them.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2951734"/>Case Study: Two Ways to Write a Calculator Program</h3></div></div><p>To be more concrete, let us contrast how the GUI and CLI styles
can be usefully applied to the design of a simple interactive program:
a desk calculator. Our examples for contrast are
dc(1)/bc(1)
and
xcalc(1).</p><p>The original Unix desk calculator program, first distributed
with Version 7, was
dc(1)&#8212;a reverse-Polish-notation calculator that could handle
unlimited-precision arithmetic. Later, an algebraic (infix notation)
calculator language,
bc(1),
was implemented on top of dc (we used the relationship between these
programs as a case study in <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter 7. Multiprogramming">Chapter 7</a>, and again in <a href="minilanguageschapter.html" title="Chapter 8. Minilanguages">Chapter 8</a>). Both of these programs use a
CLI. You type an expression on standard input, you press enter, and
the value of the expression is printed on standard output.</p><p>The
xcalc(1)
program, on the other hand, visually simulates a simple calculator,
with clickable buttons and a calculator-style display.</p><div class="figure"><a id="xcalc"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 11.1. The xcalc GUI.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/xcalc.png" alt="The xcalc GUI."/></div></div><p>The
xcalc(1)
approach is simpler to describe because it mimics an interface with
which novice users will be familiar; the man page says, in fact,
&#8220;The numbered keys, the +/&#8722; key, and the +, &#8722;, *, /, and = keys
all do exactly what you would expect them to&#8221;. All the
capabilities of the program are conveyed by the visible button
labels. This is the Rule of Least Surprise in its strongest form, and
a real advantage for infrequent and novice users who will never have
to read a man page to use the program.</p><p>However, <i>xcalc</i> also inherits the
almost complete
non-transparency<a id="id2951913" class="indexterm"/> of a calculator; when
evaluating a complex expression, you don't get to see and sanity-check
your keystrokes &#8212; which can be a problem if, say, you misplace a
decimal point in an expression like (2.51 + 4.6) * 0.3. There's no
history, so you can't check. You'll get a result, but it won't be the
result of the calculation you intended.</p><p>With the
dc(1)
and
bc(1)
programs, on the other hand, you can edit mistakes out of the
expression as you build it. Their interface is more transparent,
because you can see the calculation that is being performed at every
stage. It is more expressive because the
<i>dc</i>/<i>bc</i>
interpreter, not being limited to what fits on a reasonably-sized
visual mockup of a calculator, can include a much larger repertoire of
functions (and facilities such as if/then/else, stored variables, and
iteration). It also incurs, of course, a higher mnemonic load.</p><p>Concision is more of a toss-up; good typists will find the CLI
more concise, while poor ones may find it faster to point and
click. Scriptability is not a toss-up;
<i>dc</i>/<i>bc</i> can easily
be used as a filter, but xcalc can't be scripted at all.</p><p>The tradeoff between ease for novices and utility for expert
users is very clear here. For casual use in situations where a
mental-arithmetic error check is not hard,
<i>xcalc</i> wins. For more complex calculations
where the steps must not only be correct but must be
<span class="emphasis"><em>seen</em></span> to be correct, or in which they are most
conveniently generated by another program,
<i>dc</i>/<i>bc</i>
wins.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch11s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="interfacechapter.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch11s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Evaluating Interface Designs </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Transparency, Expressiveness, and Configurability</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
