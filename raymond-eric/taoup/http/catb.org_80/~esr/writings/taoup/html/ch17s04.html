had always been more prone than their counterparts elsewhere to treat
old code as disposable.  This was doubtless a product of the Unix
tradition's emphasis on modularity, which makes it easier to discard
and replace small pieces of systems without losing everything.  Unix
programmers have learned by experience that trying to salvage bad code
or a bad design is often more work than rebooting the project. Where
in other programming cultures the instinct would be to patch the
monster monolith because you have so much work invested in it, the
Unix instinct is usually to scrap and rebuild.</p><p>The IETF<a id="id2999926" class="indexterm"/> tradition
reinforced this by teaching us to think of code as secondary to
standards. Standards are what enable programs to cooperate; they knit
our technologies into wholes that are more than the sum of the parts.
The IETF showed us that careful standardization, aimed at capturing
the best of existing practice, is a powerful form of humility that
achieves more than grandiose attempts to remake the world around a
never-implemented ideal.</p><p>After 1980, the impact of that lesson was increasingly widely
felt in the Unix community.  Thus, while the ANSI/ISO C standard from
1989 is not completely without flaws, it is exceptionally clean and
practical for a standard of its size and importance.  The Single Unix
Specification contains fossils from three decades of experimentation
and false starts in a more complicated domain, and is therefore
messier than ANSI C.  But the component standards it was composed from
are quite good; strong evidence for this is the fact that Linus
Torvalds successfully built a Unix from scratch by reading them. The
IETF's<a id="id2999958" class="indexterm"/> quiet but
powerful example created one of the critical pieces of context that
made Linus Torvalds's feat possible.</p><p>Respect for published standards and the
IETF<a id="id2999974" class="indexterm"/> process has become
deeply ingrained in the Unix culture; deliberately violating Internet
STDs is simply Not Done.  This can sometimes create chasms of mutual
incomprehension between people with a Unix background and others prone
to assume that the most popular or widely deployed implementation of a
protocol is by definition correct &#8212; even if it breaks the
standard so severely that it will not interoperate with properly
conforming software.</p><p>The Unix programmer's respect for published standards is more
interesting because he is likely to be rather hostile to a-priori
specifications of other kinds.  By the time the &#8216;waterfall
model&#8217;<a id="id2999998" class="indexterm"/>
(specify exhaustively first, then implement, then debug, with no
reverse motion at any stage) fell out of favor in the
software-engineering literature, it had been an object of derision
among Unix programmers for years.  Experience, and a strong tradition
of collaborative development, had already taught them that prototyping
and repeated cycles of test and evolution are a better
way.</p><p>The Unix tradition clearly recognizes that there can be great
value in good specifications, but it demands that they be treated as
provisional and subject to revision through field experience in the
way that Internet-Drafts and Proposed Standards are.  In best Unix
practice, the documentation of the program is used as a specification
subject to revision analogously to an Internet Proposed
Standard.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#160;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Unlike other environments, in Unix development the documentation is often
written before the program, or at least in conjunction with it.  For X11, the
core X standards were finished before the first release of X and have remained
essentially unchanged since that date. Compatibility among different X systems
is improved further by rigorous specification-driven testing.</p><p>The existence of a well-written specification made the
development of the X test suite much easier.  Each statement in the X
specification was translated into code to test the implementation, a
few minor inconsistencies were uncovered in the specification during
this process, but the result is a test suite that covers a significant
fraction of the code paths within the sample X library and server, and
all without referring to the source code of that implementation.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top">&#160;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

major advantage.  While field experience and advances in the state
of the graphics art led many to criticize X on design grounds, and
various portions of it (such as the security and user-resource models) came
to seem clumsy and over-engineered, the X implementation achieved a
remarkable level of stability and cross-vendor interoperation.</p><p>In <a href="generationchapter.html" title="Chapter&#160;9.&#160;Generation">Chapter&#160;9</a>
we discussed the value of pushing coding up to the highest possible
level to minimize the effects of constant defect density.  Implicit in
Keith Packard's account is the idea that the X documentation
constituted no mere wish-list but a form of high-level code.  Another
key X developer confirms this:</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#160;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>In X, the specification has always ruled.  Sometimes specs have bugs that
need to be fixed too, but code is usually buggier than specs (for any
spec worth its ink, anyway).</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top">&#160;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

similar to the IETF's<a id="id3000142" class="indexterm"/>.
Nor is its utility limited to constructing good test suites; it means
that arguments about the system's behavior can be conducted at a
functional level with respect to the specification, avoiding too much
entanglement in implementation issues.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#160;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Having a well-considered specification driving development allows for
little argument about bug vs. feature; a system which incorrectly implements the
specification is broken and should be fixed.</p><p>I suspect this is so ingrained into most of us that we lose
sight of its power.</p><p>A friend of mine who worked for a small software firm east of
Bellevue wondered how Linux applications developers could get OS
changes synchronized with application releases.  In that company,
major system-level APIs change frequently to accommodate application
whims and so essential OS functionality must often be released along
with each application.</p><p>I described the power held by the specifications and how the
implementation was subservient to them, and then went on to assert
that an application which got an unexpected result from a documented
interface was either broken or had discovered a bug.  He found this
concept startling.</p><p>Discerning such bugs is a simple matter of verifying the
implementation of the interface against the specification.  Of course,
having source for the implementation makes that a bit easier.

well.  While that no-longer-small company east of Bellevue has trouble
keeping its office suite compatible with its own previous releases,
GUI applications written for X11 in 1988 still run without change on
today's X implementations.  In the Unix world, this sort of longevity
is normal &#8212; and the standards-as-DNA attitude is the reason
why.</p><p>Thus, experience shows that the standards-respecting,
scrap-and-rebuild culture of Unix tends to yield better
interoperability over extended time than perpetual patching of a code
base without a standard to provide guidance and continuity.  This
may, indeed, be one of the most important Unix lessons.</p><p>Keith's last comment brings us directly to an issue that the
success of open-source Unixes has brought to the forefront &#8212; the
relationship between open standards and open source.   We'll address
this at the end of the chapter &#8212; but before doing that, it's
time to address the practical question of how Unix programmers 
can actually <span class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the tremendous body of
accumulated standards and lore to achieve software portability.</p></div></body></html>
