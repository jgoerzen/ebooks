sites, it was the Master's custom in the evenings to offer public
instruction to Unix neophytes of the towns and villages in which they
stopped for the night.</p><p>On one such occasion, a methodologist was among those

boat?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Because he could not swim&#8221;, replied Master Foo.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the methodologist was enlightened.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="two_paths.html">Prev</a>&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="unix_koans.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&#160;<a accesskey="n" href="gui-programmer.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Master Foo Discourses on the Two Paths&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&#160;Master Foo Discourses on the
