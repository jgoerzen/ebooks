several technical and cultural traits that set it apart from the way
documentation is done elsewhere.  Understanding these signature traits
first will create context for you to understand why the programs
and the practice look the way they do, and why the documentation reads
the way it does.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3001392"/>The Large-Document Bias</h3></div></div><p>Unix documentation tools have always been designed primarily for
the challenges involved in composing large and complex documents.
Originally it was patent applications and paperwork; later it was
scientific and technical papers, technical documentation of all sorts.
Consequently, most Unix developers learned to love markup-centered
documentation tools.  Unlike the PC users of the time, the Unix
culture was unimpressed with WYSIWYG word processors when they became
generally available in the late 1980s and early 1990s &#8212; and even
among today's younger Unix hackers it is still unusual to find anyone
who really prefers them.</p><p>Dislike of opaque binary document formats &#8212; and especially
of opaque <span class="emphasis"><em>proprietary</em></span> binary formats &#8212; also
played a part in the rejection of WYSIWYG tools.  On the other hand,
Unix programmers seized on PostScript (the now-standard language for
controlling imaging printers) with enthusiasm as soon as the language
documentation became available; it fits neatly in the Unix tradition
of domain-specific languages.  Modern open-source Unix systems have
excellent PostScript and Portable Document Format
(PDF)<a id="id3001430" class="indexterm"/> tools.</p><p>Another consequence of this history is that Unix documentation
tools have tended to have relatively weak support for including
images, but strong support for diagrams, tables, graphing, and
mathematical typesetting &#8212; the sorts of things often needed in
technical papers.</p><p>The Unix attachment to markup-centered systems has often been
caricatured as a prejudice or a troglodyte trait, but it is not really
anything of the kind.  Just as the putatively &#8216;primitive&#8217;
CLI style of Unix is in many ways better adapted to the needs of power
users than GUIs, the markup-centered design of tools like
troff(1)
is a better fit for the needs of power documenters than are WYSIWYG
programs.</p><p>The large-document bias in Unix tradition did not just keep Unix
developers attached to markup-based formatters like
<i>troff</i>, it also made them interested in
structural markup.  The history of Unix document tools is one of
lurching, muddled, and erratic movement in a general direction away
from presentation markup and toward structural markup.  In mid-2003
this journey is not yet over, but the end is distantly in
sight.</p><p>The development of the World Wide Web meant that the ability to
render documents in multiple media (or, at least, for both print and
HTML display) became the central challenge for documentation tools
after about 1993.  At the same time, even ordinary users were, under
the influence of HTML, becoming more comfortable with markup-centered
systems.  This led directly to an explosion of interest in structural
markup and the invention of XML after 1996.  Suddenly the old-time
Unix attachment to markup-centered systems started looking prescient
rather than reactionary.</p><p>Today, in mid-2003, most of the leading-edge development of
XML-based documentation tools using structural markup is taking place
under Unix.  But, at the same time, the Unix culture has yet to let go
of its older tradition of presentation-level markup systems. The
creaking, clanking, armor-plated dinosaur that is
<i>troff</i> has only partly been displaced by
HTML and XML.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3001522"/>Cultural Style</h3></div></div><p>Most software documentation is written by technical writers for
the least-common-denominator ignorant &#8212; the knowledgeable
writing for the knowledgeless.  The documentation that ships with Unix
systems has traditionally been written by programmers for their peers.
Even when it is not peer-to-peer documentation, it tends to be
influenced in style and format by the enormous mass of
programmer-to-programmer documentation that ships with Unix
systems.</p><p>The difference this makes can be summed up in one observation:
Unix manual pages traditionally have a section called BUGS.  In other
cultures, technical writers try to make the product look good by
omitting and skating over known bugs.  In the Unix culture, peers
describe the known shortcomings of their software to each other in
unsparing detail, and users consider a short but informative BUGS
section to be an encouraging sign of quality work.  Commercial Unix
distributions that have broken this convention, either by suppressing
the BUGS section or euphemizing it to a softer tag like LIMITATIONS or
ISSUES or APPLICATION USAGE, have invariably fallen into
decline.</p><p>Where most other software documentation tends to to oscillate
between incomprehensibility and oversimplifying condescension, classic
Unix documentation is written to be telegraphic but complete.  It does
not hold you by the hand, but it usually points in the right
direction.  The style assumes an active reader, one who is able
to deduce obvious unsaid consequences of what is said, and who has
the self-confidence to trust those deductions.</p><p>Unix programmers tend to be good at writing references,
and most Unix documentation has the flavor of a reference or
<span class="foreignphrase"><i>aide memoire</i></span> for someone who thinks
like the document-writer but is not yet an expert at his or her
software.  The results often look much more cryptic and sparse than
they actually are.  Read every word carefully, because whatever you
want to know will probably be there, or deducible from what's there.
Read every word carefully, because you will seldom be told anything
twice.</p></div></div></body></html>
