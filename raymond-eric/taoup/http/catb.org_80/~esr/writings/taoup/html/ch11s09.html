without exploring one of the oldest and most persistent design tropes
of Unix, the Rule of Silence.  We observed in <a href="philosophychapter.html" title="Chapter 1. Philosophy">Chapter 1</a> that well-designed
Unix programs with nothing interesting or surprising to say should
shut up, and suggested there are good reasons for this that have long
outlasted the slow teletypes on which Unix was born.</p><p>Here's one: Programs that babble don't tend to play well with
other programs.  If your CLI program emits status messages to standard
output, then programs that try to interpret that output will be put to
the trouble of interpreting or discarding those messages (even if
nothing went wrong!).  Better to send only real errors to standard
error and not to emit unrequested data at all.</p><p>Here's another: The user's vertical screen space is precious.
Every line of junk your program emits is one less line of context
still available on the user's display.</p><p>Here's a third: Junk messages are a careless waste of the human
user's bandwidth.  They're one more source of distracting motion on a
screen display that may be mediating for more important foreground
tasks, such as communication with other humans.</p><p>Go ahead and give your GUIs progress bars for long operations.
That's good style &#8212; it helps the user time-share his brain
efficiently by cuing him that he can go off and read mail or do other
things while waiting for completion.  But don't clutter GUI interfaces
with confirmation popups except when you have to guard operations
that might lose or trash data &#8212; and even then, hide them when
the parent window is minimized, and bury them unless the parent window
has focus.<sup>[<a id="id2960697" href="#ftn.id2960697">111</a>]</sup>  Your job as an
interface designer is to assist the user, not to gratuitously get in
his face.</p><p>In general, it's bad style to tell the user things he already
knows (&quot;Program &lt;foo&gt; is starting up...&quot;, or &quot;Program
&lt;foo&gt; is exiting&quot; are two classic offenders).  Your interface
design as a whole should obey the Rule of Least Surprise, but the
content of messages should obey a Rule of <span class="emphasis"><em>Most</em></span>
Surprise &#8212; be chatty only about things that deviate from
what's normally expected.</p><p>This rule has even greater force for confirmation prompts.
Constantly asking for confirmation where the answer is almost always
&#8220;yes&#8221; conditions the user to press &#8220;yes&#8221; without
thinking about it, a habit that can have very unfortunate
consequences.  Programs should request confirmation only when there is
good reason to suspect that the answer might be &#8220;no no
no!&#8221;  A confirmation request that is not a surprise is a
strong hint of bad design.  Any confirmation prompts at all may be a
sign that what your interface really needs is an undo command.</p><p>If you want chatty progress messages for debugging purposes,
disable them by default with a verbosity switch.  Before releasing for
production, relegate as many of the normal messages as possible to
being displayed only when the verbosity switch is on.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2960697" href="#id2960697">111</a>] </sup>If your windowing system supports translucent
