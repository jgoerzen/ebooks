Our
discussion is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> going to be about using
concurrency to improve performance. Putting that concern before
developing a clean architecture that minimizes global complexity is
premature optimization<a id="id2918577" class="indexterm"/>,
the root of all evil (see <a href="optimizationchapter.html" title="Chapter 12. Optimization">Chapter 12</a> for further discussion).</p><p>A closely related red herring is threads (that is, multiple
concurrent processes sharing the same memory-address space). Threading is a
performance hack.  To avoid a long diversion here, we'll
examine threads in more detail at the end of this chapter; the
summary is that they do not reduce global complexity but rather
<span class="emphasis"><em>increase</em></span> it, and should therefore be avoided 
save under dire necessity.</p><p>Respecting the Rule of Modularity, on the other hand, is
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a red herring; doing so can make your
programs &#8212; and your life &#8212; simpler. All the reasons for
process partitioning are continuous with the reasons for module
partitioning that we developed in <a href="modularitychapter.html" title="Chapter 4. Modularity">Chapter 4</a>.</p><p>Another important reason for breaking up programs into
cooperating processes is for better security.  Under Unix, programs
that must be run by ordinary users, but must have write access to
security-critical system resources, get that access through a feature
called the <i>setuid bit</i>.<sup>[<a id="id2915417" href="#ftn.id2915417">66</a>]</sup>  Executable files are the smallest unit
of code that can hold a setuid bit; thus, every line of code in a
setuid executable must be trusted.  (Well-written setuid programs,
however, take all necessary privileged actions first and then drop
their privileges back to user level for the remainder of their
existence.)</p><p>Usually a setuid program only needs its privileges for one or a
small handful of operations.  It is often possible to break up such a
program into cooperating processes, a smaller one that needs setuid
and a larger one that does not.  When we can do this, only the code in
the smaller program has to be trusted.  It is in significant part
because this kind of partitioning and delegation is possible that Unix
has a better security track record<sup>[<a id="id2915447" href="#ftn.id2915447">67</a>]</sup> than its competitors.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2915417" href="#id2915417">66</a>] </sup>A setuid
program runs not with the privileges of the user calling it, but with
the privileges of the owner of the executable. This feature can be
used to give restricted, program-controlled access to things like the
password file that nonadministrators should not be allowed to modify
directly.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2915447" href="#id2915447">67</a>] </sup>That is, a better
record measured in security breaches per total machine hours of
