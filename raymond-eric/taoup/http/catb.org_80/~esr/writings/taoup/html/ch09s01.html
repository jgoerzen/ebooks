clearly distinguishes code from the data structures on which it acts,
and designs both so that one can make changes to the logic of the program 
by editing not the code but the data structure.</p><p>Data-driven programming is sometimes confused with object
orientation<a id="id2939680" class="indexterm"/>, another style in which data
organization is supposed to be central.  There are at least two
differences.  One is that in data-driven programming, the data is not
merely the state of some object, but actually defines the control flow
of the program.  Where the primary concern in
OO<a id="id2939694" class="indexterm"/> is
encapsulation, the primary concern in data-driven programming is
writing as little fixed code as possible.  Unix has a stronger
tradition of data-driven programming than of OO.</p><p>Programming data-driven style is also sometimes confused with
writing state machines.  It is in fact possible to express the logic
of a state machine as a table or data structure, but hand-coded state
machines are usually rigid blocks of code that are far harder to
modify than a table.</p><p>An important rule when doing any kind of code generation or
data-driven programming is this: always push problems upstream.  Don't
hack the generated code or any intermediate representations by hand
&#8212; instead, think of a way to improve or replace your translation
tool.  Otherwise you're likely to find that hand-patching bits which
should have been generated correctly by machine will have turned into
an infinite time sink.</p><p>At the upper end of its complexity scale, data-driven
programming merges into writing interpreters for p-code or simple
minilanguages of the kind we surveyed in <a href="minilanguageschapter.html" title="Chapter 8. Minilanguages">Chapter 8</a>.  At other edges, it merges into code
generation and state-machine programming.  The distinctions are not
actually that important; the important part is moving program logic
away from hardwired control structures and into data.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2939746"/>Case Study: <i>ascii</i></h3></div></div><p>I maintain a program called <i>ascii</i>, a
very simple little utility that tries to interpret its command-line
arguments as names of ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange) characters and report all the equivalent names.  Code and
documentation for the tool are available from the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/ascii" target="_top">project page</a>. Here is an illustrative
screenshot:</p><pre class="screen">
esr@snark:~/WWW/writings/taoup$ ascii 10
ASCII 1/0 is decimal 016, hex 10, octal 020, bits 00010000: called ^P, DLE
Official name: Data Link Escape

ASCII 0/10 is decimal 010, hex 0a, octal 012, bits 00001010: called ^J, LF, NL
Official name: Line Feed
C escape: '\n'
Other names: Newline

ASCII 0/8 is decimal 008, hex 08, octal 010, bits 00001000: called ^H, BS
Official name: Backspace
C escape: '\b'
Other names:

ASCII 0/2 is decimal 002, hex 02, octal 002, bits 00000010: called ^B, STX
Official name: Start of Text
</pre><p>One indication that this program was a good idea is the fact
that it has an unexpected use &#8212; as a quick CLI aid to converting
between decimal, hex, octal, and binary representations of bytes.</p><p>The main logic of this program could have been coded as a 
128-branch case statement.  This would, however, have made the code
bulky and difficult to maintain.  It would also have tangled parts
that change relatively rapidly (like the list of slang names for
characters) with parts that change slowly or not at all (like
the official names), putting them both in the same legend string and
making errors during editing much more likely to touch data that
ought to be stable.</p><p>Instead, we apply data-driven programming.  All the character
name strings live in a table structure that is quite a bit larger than
any of the functions in the code (indeed, counted in lines it is
larger than any <span class="emphasis"><em>three</em></span> of the functions in the
program).  The code merely navigates the table and does low-level
tasks like radix conversions.  The initializer actually lives in the
file <tt>nametable.h</tt>, which is generated in a way
we'll describe later in this chapter.</p><p>This organization makes it easy to add new character names,
change existing ones, or delete old names by simply editing the table,
without disturbing the code.</p><p>(The way the program is built is good Unix style, but the
output format is questionable.  It's hard to see how the output could
usefully become the input of any other program, so it does not play
well with others.)</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="bayes_spam"/>Case Study: Statistical Spam Filtering</h3></div></div><p>One interesting case of data-driven programming is statistical
learning algorithms for detecting spam (unsolicited bulk email).
A whole class of mail filter programs (those easily findable
by Web search include <i>popfile</i>,
<i>spambayes</i>, and
<i>bogofilter</i>) use a database of word
correlations to replace the elaborate pattern-matching conditional
logic of pattern-matching spam filters.</p><p>Programs like these became common on the Internet very rapidly
following Paul Graham's landmark paper <i>A Plan for
Spam</i> [<a href="apb.html#Graham" title="[Graham]">Graham</a>] in 2002.  While the
explosion was triggered by the increasing cost of the pattern-matching
arms race, the statistical-filtering idea was adopted first and
fastest by Unix shops.  In part, this was certainly because almost all
the Internet service providers (who are most burdened by spam, and
thus had most incentive to adopt effective new techniques) are Unix
shops &#8212; but undoubtedly the harmony with some traditional themes
in Unix software design helped as well.</p><p>Conventional spam filters require that a system administrator,
or some other responsible party, maintain information on patterns of
text found in spam &#8212; names of sites that emit nothing but spam,
come-on phrases often used by pornography sites or Internet scam
artists, and the like.  In his paper, Graham noted accurately that
computer programmers like the idea of pattern-matching filters, and
sometimes have difficulty seeing past that approach, because it offers
them so many opportunities to be clever.</p><p>Statistical spam filters, on the other hand, work by collecting
feedback about what the user judges to be spam versus nonspam.  That
feedback is processed into databases of statistical correlation
coefficients or <i>weights</i> connecting words or phrases
to the user's spam/nonspam classification.  The most popular
algorithms use minor variants of Bayes's Theorem on conditional
probabilities, but other techniques (including various sorts of
polynomial hashing) are also employed.</p><p>In all these programs, the correlation check is a relatively
trivial mathematical formula.  The weights fed into the formula along
with the message being checked serve as implicit control
structure for the filtering algorithm.</p><p>The problem with conventional pattern-matching spam filters is 
that they are brittle.  Spammers are constantly gaming against the
filter-rule databases, forcing the filter maintainers to constantly
reprogram their filters to stay ahead in the arms race.  Statistical
spam filters generate their own filter rules from the user feedback.</p><p>In fact, experience with statistical filters seems to show that the 
particular learning algorithm used is far less important than the
quality of the spam and nonspam data sets from which the learning algorithm
computes its weights.  So the results of statistical filters really
are driven more by the shape of the data than by the algorithm.</p><p><i>A Plan for Spam</i> was something of a
bombshell because its author argued convincingly that a simple, even
crude, statistical approach gave a lower rate of nonspam being
erroneously classified as spam than either elaborate pattern-matching
techniques or the human eyeball could manage.  For Unix programmers,
seeing past the lure of clever pattern-matching was far easier than in
other programming cultures without as strong an attachment to

fetchmailconf(1)
dotfile configurator shipped with
fetchmail(1)<a id="id2937860" class="indexterm"/>
contains an instructive example of advanced data-driven programming in
a very high-level, object-oriented <a id="id2937871" class="indexterm"/> language.</p><p>In October 1997 a series of questions on the fetchmail-friends
mailing list made it clear that end-users were having increasing
troubles generating configuration files for
<i>fetchmail</i>.  The file uses a simple,
classically-Unixy free-format syntax, but can become forbiddingly
complicated when a user has POP3 and IMAP accounts at multiple sites.
See <a href="#fetchmail_example" title="Example 9.1. Example of fetchmailrc syntax.">Example 9.1</a> for a somewhat simplified
version of the <i>fetchmail</i> author's
configuration file.</p><div class="example"><a id="fetchmail_example"/><p class="title"><b>Example 9.1. Example of fetchmailrc syntax.</b></p><pre class="programlisting">

</pre></div><p>The design objective of <i>fetchmailconf</i>
was to completely hide the control file syntax behind a fashionable,
ergonomically-correct GUI replete with selection buttons,
slider bars and fill-out forms.  But the beta design had a problem: it
could easily generate configuration files from the user's GUI actions,
but could not read and edit existing ones.</p><p>The parser for
<i>fetchmail</i>'s<a id="id2937966" class="indexterm"/>
configuration file syntax is rather elaborate.  It's actually written
in <i>yacc</i> and <i>lex</i>,
the two classic Unix tools for generating language-parsing code in C.
For <i>fetchmailconf</i> to be able to edit
existing configuration files, it at first appeared that it would be
necessary to replicate that elaborate parser in fetchmailconf's
implementation language &#8212; Python.</p><p>This tactic seemed doomed.  Even leaving aside the amount of
duplicative work implied, it is notoriously hard to be certain that
two parsers in two different languages accept the same grammar.
Keeping them synchronized as the configuration language evolved bid
fair to be a maintenance nightmare.  It would have violated the SPOT
rule<a id="id2938011" class="indexterm"/> we discussed
in <a href="modularitychapter.html" title="Chapter 4. Modularity">Chapter 4</a>
wholesale.</p><p>This problem stumped me for a while.  The insight that cracked
it was that <i>fetchmailconf</i> could use
<i>fetchmail</i>'s own parser as a filter!  I
added a <tt>--configdump</tt> option to
<i>fetchmail</i> that would parse
<tt>.fetchmailrc</tt> and dump the result to standard
output in the format of a Python initializer.  For the file above, the
result would look roughly like <a href="#conf_dump" title="Example 9.2. Python structure dump of a fetchmail configuration.">Example 9.2</a> (to save

then evaluate the <i>fetchmail</i>
<tt>--configdump</tt> output and read the configuration
available to <i>fetchmailconf</i> as the value of
the variable &#8216;fetchmail&#8217;.</p><p>But this wasn't quite the last obstacle in the race.  What was
really needed wasn't just for <i>fetchmailconf</i>
to have the existing configuration, but to turn it into a linked tree
of live objects.  There would be three kinds of objects in this tree:
<tt>Configuration</tt> (the top-level object representing the
entire configuration), <tt>Site</tt> (representing one of the
servers to be polled), and <tt>User</tt> (representing user data
attached to a site).  The example file describes three site objects, each
with one user object attached to it.</p><p>The three object classes already existed in
<i>fetchmailconf</i>.  Each had a method that
caused it to pop up a GUI edit panel to modify its instance data.  The
last remaining problem was to somehow transform the static data in this
Python initializer into live objects.</p><p>I considered writing a glue layer that would explicitly
know about the structure of all three classes and use that knowledge
to grovel through the initializer creating matching objects, but
rejected that idea because new class members were likely to be added
over time as the configuration language grew new features.  If the
object-creation code were written in the obvious way, it would once
again be fragile and tend to fall out of synchronization when either
the class definitions or the initializer structure dumped by the
<tt>--configdump</tt> report generator changed.  Again, a
recipe for endless bugs.</p><p>The better way would be data-driven programming &#8212; code
that would analyze the shape and members of the initializer, query the
class definitions themselves about their members, and then
impedance-match the two sets.</p><p>Lisp<a id="id2938241" class="indexterm"/> and

programmers call this <i>introspection</i>; in
some other object-oriented languages it's called <span class="emphasis"><em>metaclass

deep black magic.  Most object-oriented languages don't support it at
all; in those that do (Perl<a id="id2938270" class="indexterm"/> and Java among them), it tends to be a
complicated and fragile undertaking.  But Python's facilities for

the Unix tradition.  If meditating on Unix programming as practiced by

&#8212; insisting on reuse, and refusing to write duplicative glue
code in accordance with the SPOT rule<a id="id2938448" class="indexterm"/>&#8212;I might have rushed into coding a

never have happened.</p><p>The second insight (that <tt>copy_instance</tt> could be generic) proceeded from
the Unix tradition of looking assiduously for ways to avoid
hand-hacking. But more specifically, Unix programmers are very used to
writing parser specifications to generate parsers for processing
language-like markups; from there it was a short step to believing
that the rest of the job could be done by some kind of generic
tree-walk of the configuration structure. Two separate stages of
data-driven programming, one building on the other, were needed to
solve the design problem cleanly.</p><p>Insights like this can be extraordinarily powerful.  The code we
have been looking at was written in about ninety minutes, worked the
first time it was run, and has been stable in the years since (the
only time it has ever broken is when it threw an exception in the
presence of genuine version skew).  It's less than forty lines and
beautifully simple.  There is no way that the naïve approach of
building an entire second parser could possibly have produced this
