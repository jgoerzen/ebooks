for GUI programming.  Recall the discussion in <a href="philosophychapter.html" title="Chapter&#160;1.&#160;Philosophy">Chapter&#160;1</a> of how X separates mechanism from
policy.  Each possible choice of toolkit will give you a slightly
different look and feel.</p><p>Your choice of X toolkit will be connected to your choice of
application language in two ways: first, because some languages ship
with a binding to a preferred toolkit, and second because some
toolkits only have bindings to a limited set of languages.</p><p>Java<a id="id2978702" class="indexterm"/>, of
course, has its own cross-platform toolkits built in, so your choice
will be between AWT (universally deployed) and Swing (more capable,
more complex, slower, and only in JDK 1.2/Java 2). The remainder of
this section focuses on the other languages we have
surveyed. Similarly, if you're using Tcl, Tk comes bundled.  There
probably is not a lot of point in evaluating alternatives.</p><p>The once-ubiquitous Motif toolkit is effectively dead. It
couldn't keep up with the newer toolkits distributed without license fees
or restrictions.  These attracted more developer effort until they
surged past closed-source toolkits in capability and features;
nowadays, the competition is all in open source.</p><p>The four toolkits to consider seriously in 2003 are Tk,
GTK, Qt, and wxWindows, with GTK and Qt being the clear front runners.
All four have ports on MacOS and Windows, so any choice will give you
the capability to do cross-platform development.</p><p>The Tk toolkit is the oldest of the four and has the advantage
of incumbency; it's native in Tcl and bindings to it are shipped with
the stock version of Python<a id="id2978744" class="indexterm"/>.  Libraries to provide language
bindings to Tk are generally available for C<a id="id2978754" class="indexterm"/> and C++<a id="id2978762" class="indexterm"/>.  Unfortunately, Tk also shows its age
in that its standard widget set is both limited and rather ugly.  On
the other hand, the Tk Canvas widget has capabilities that other
toolkits still match only with difficulty.</p><p>GTK began life as a replacement for Motif, and was invented to
support the GIMP<a id="id2978780" class="indexterm"/>.  It is
now the preferred toolkit of the GNOME project and is used by hundreds
of GNOME applications. The native API is C; bindings are available for
C++<a id="id2978791" class="indexterm"/>,
Perl<a id="id2978800" class="indexterm"/>, and
Python<a id="id2978808" class="indexterm"/>, but
do not ship with the stock language distributions.  It's the only one
of these four with a native C binding.</p><p>Qt is a toolkit associated with the KDE project.  It is natively
a C++<a id="id2978824" class="indexterm"/> library;
bindings are available for Python<a id="id2978833" class="indexterm"/> and Perl<a id="id2978842" class="indexterm"/> but do not ship with the stock
interpreters. Qt has a reputation for having the best-designed and
most expressive API of these four, but adoption was initially hindered
by controversy over early versions of the Qt license and was further
slowed down by the fact that a C binding was slow in coming.</p><p>wxWindows is also natively C++<a id="id2978860" class="indexterm"/> with bindings available in
Perl<a id="id2978869" class="indexterm"/> and
Python<a id="id2978878" class="indexterm"/>.  The
wxWindows developers emphasize their support for cross-platform
development heavily and appear to regard it as the main selling point
of the toolkit.  Another selling point is that wxWindows is actually a
wrapper around the native (GTK, Windows, and MacOS 9) widgets on each
platform, so applications written using it retain a native look and
feel.</p><p>As of mid-2003 few detailed comparisons have been written, but
a Web search for &#8220;X toolkit comparison&#8221; may turn up some
useful hits. <a href="#x_toolkits" title="Table&#160;14.2.&#160;Summary of X Toolkits.">Table&#160;14.2</a> summarizes the
state of play.</p><div class="table"><a id="x_toolkits"/><p class="title"><b>Table&#160;14.2.&#160;Summary of X Toolkits.</b></p><table summary="Summary of X Toolkits." border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Toolkit</th><th rowspan="2">Native language</th><th rowspan="2">Shipped with</th><th colspan="5">Bindings</th></tr><tr><th>C</th><th>C++</th><th>Perl</th><th>Tcl</th><th>Python</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tk</td><td>Tcl</td><td>Tcl, Python</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>GTK</td><td>C</td><td>Gnome</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>Qt</td><td>C++</td><td>KDE</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>wxWindows</td><td>C++</td><td>&#8212;</td><td>&#8212;</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Architecturally, these libraries are all written at about the
same abstraction level.  GTK and Qt use a slot-and-signal apparatus
for event-handling so similar that ports between them have been
reported to be almost trivial.  Your choice among them will probably
be conditioned more by the availability of bindings to your chosen
development language than anything else.</p></div></body></html>
