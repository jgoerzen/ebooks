The way
you put them together and package them for distribution matters,
too. Unix provides a tool for semi-automating these processes;
make(1).
<i>Make</i> is covered in most introductory Unix
books. For a really thorough reference, you can consult
<i>Managing Projects with Make</i> [<a href="apb.html#Oram-Talbot" title="[Oram-Talbot]">Oram-Talbot</a>]. If you're using
<i>GNU make</i> (the most advanced make, and the
one normally shipped with open-source Unixes) the treatment in
<i>Programming with GNU Software</i> [<a href="apb.html#Loukides-Oram" title="[Loukides-Oram]">Loukides-Oram</a>] may be better in some
respects. Most Unixes that carry <i>GNU make</i>
will also support GNU Emacs; if yours does you will probably find a
complete make manual on-line through Emacs's
<i>info</i> documentation system.</p><p>Ports of <i>GNU make</i> to DOS and Windows
are available from the FSF<a id="id2986540" class="indexterm"/>.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2986550"/>Basic Theory of <i>make</i></h3></div></div><p>If you're developing in C<a id="id2986564" class="indexterm"/> or C++<a id="id2986572" class="indexterm"/>, an important part of the recipe for
building your application will be the collection of compilation and
linkage commands needed to get from your sources to working
binaries. Entering these commands is a lot of tedious detail work, and
most modern development environments include a way to put them in
command files or databases that can automatically be re-executed to
build your application.</p><p>Unix's
make(1)
program, the original of all these facilities, was designed
specifically to help C programmers manage these recipes. It lets you
write down the dependencies between files in a project in one or more
&#8216;makefiles&#8217;. Each makefile consists of a series of
<span class="emphasis"><em>productions</em></span>; each one tells
<i>make</i> that some given target file depends on
some set of source files, and says what to do if any of the sources
are newer than the target. You don't actually have to write down all
dependencies, as the <i>make</i> program can
deduce a lot of the obvious ones from filenames and
extensions.</p><p>For example: You might put in a makefile that the binary
<tt>myprog</tt> depends on three object files
<tt>myprog.o</tt>, <tt>helper.o</tt>, and
<tt>stuff.o</tt>. If you have source files
<tt>myprog.c</tt>, <tt>helper.c</tt>, and
<tt>stuff.c</tt>, <i>make</i> will
know without being told that each <tt>.o</tt> file depends
on the corresponding <tt>.c</tt> file, and supply its own
standard recipe for building a <tt>.o</tt> file from a <tt>.c</tt>
file.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Make originated with a visit from Steve Johnson (author of
<i>yacc</i>, etc.), storming into my office, cursing
the Fates that had caused him to waste a morning debugging a correct
program (bug had been fixed, file hadn't been compiled, <b>cc
*.o</b> was therefore unaffected).  As I had spent a part of the
previous evening coping with the same disaster on a project I was
working on, the idea of a tool to solve it came up.  It began with an
elaborate idea of a dependency analyzer, boiled down to something much
simpler, and turned into Make that weekend.  Use of tools that were
still wet was part of the culture. Makefiles were text files, not
magically encoded binaries, because that was the Unix ethos:
printable, debuggable, understandable stuff.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

the sources for
<i>fetchmail</i><a id="id2986806" class="indexterm"/>.
In the subsections below we'll refer to it again.</p><p>Very complex makefiles, especially when they call subsidiary
makefiles, can become a source of complications rather than
simplifying the build process.  A now-classic warning is issued
in <i>Recursive Make Considered
Harmful</i>.<sup>[<a id="id2986827" href="#ftn.id2986827">136</a>]</sup>  The argument in this paper has
become widely accepted since it was written in 1997, and has come
near to reversing previous community practice.</p><p>No discussion of
make(1)
would be complete without an acknowledgement that it includes one of
the worst design botches in the history of Unix. The use of tab
characters as a required leader for command lines associated with a
production means that the interpretation of a makefile can change
drastically on the basis of invisible differences in whitespace.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Why the tab in column 1?

Development</h3></div></div><p><i>make</i> is not just useful for C/C++
recipes, however.  Scripting languages like those we described in
<a href="languageschapter.html" title="Chapter 14. Languages">Chapter 14</a> may not require
conventional compilation and link steps, but there are often other
kinds of dependencies that
make(1)
can help you with.</p><p>Suppose, for example, that you actually generate part of your
code from a specification file, using one of the techniques from <a href="generationchapter.html" title="Chapter 9. Generation">Chapter 9</a>. You can use
<i>make</i> to tie the spec file and the generated
source together. This will ensure that whenever you change the spec
and remake, the generated code will automatically be rebuilt.</p><p>It's quite common to use makefile productions to express recipes
for making documentation as well as code. You'll often see this
approach used to automatically generate PostScript or other derived
documentation from masters written in some markup language (like HTML
or one of the Unix document-macro languages we'll survey in <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter 18. Documentation">Chapter 18</a>). In fact, this sort of use is so
common that it's worth illustrating with a case study.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2986982"/>Case Study: <i>make</i> for Document-File Translation</h4></div></div><p>In the
fetchmail<a id="id2986998" class="indexterm"/> makefile,
for example, you'll see three productions that relate files named
<tt>FAQ</tt>, <tt>FEATURES</tt>, and
<tt>NOTES</tt> to HTML sources
<tt>fetchmail-FAQ.html</tt>,
<tt>fetchmail-features.html</tt>, and
<tt>design-notes.html</tt>.</p><p>The HTML files are meant to be accessible on the fetchmail Web
page, but all the HTML markup makes them uncomfortable to look at
unless you're using a browser. So the <tt>FAQ</tt>,
<tt>FEATURES</tt>, and <tt>NOTES</tt> are
flat-text files meant to be flipped through quickly with an editor or
pager program by someone reading the <i>fetchmail</i>
sources themselves (or, perhaps, distributed to FTP sites that don't
support Web access).</p><p>The flat-text forms can be made from their HTML masters by using
the common open-source program
lynx(1).
<i>lynx</i> is a Web browser for text-only
displays; but when invoked with the <tt>-dump</tt> option it
functions reasonably well as an HTML-to-ASCII formatter.</p><p>With the productions in place, the developer can edit the HTML
masters without having to remember to manually rebuild the flat-text
forms afterwards, secure in the knowledge that
<tt>FAQ</tt>, <tt>FEATURES</tt>, and
<tt>NOTES</tt> will be properly rebuilt whenever they are
needed.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2987148"/>Utility Productions</h3></div></div><p>Some of the most heavily used productions in typical makefiles

little procedures that a developer wants to mechanize, like making
a distribution package or removing all object files in order to do

from expected behavior during the development process. The

software to ensure that their installation is functioning correctly.

at best careless, and (when, for example, an installation creates
large database files) can be quite rude and thoughtless.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Working examples of all the standard targets are available for
inspection in the
<i>fetchmail</i><a id="id2987604" class="indexterm"/>

emerge, and (not incidentally) learn much about the
<i>fetchmail</i> package's structure. One of the
benefits of using these standard productions is that they form an
implicit roadmap of their project.</p><p>But you need not limit yourself to these utility productions.
Once you master <i>make</i>, you'll find yourself
more and more often using the makefile machinery to automate little
tasks that depend on your project file state. Your makefile is a
convenient central place to put these; using it makes them readily
available for inspection and avoids cluttering up your workspace with
trivial little scripts.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2987644"/>Generating Makefiles</h3></div></div><p>One of the subtle advantages of Unix
<i>make</i> over the dependency databases built
into many IDEs is that makefiles are simple text files &#8212; files
that can be generated by programs.</p><p>In the mid-1980s it was fairly common for large Unix program
distributions to include elaborate custom shellscripts that would
probe their environment and use the information they gathered to
construct custom makefiles.  These custom configurators reached absurd
sizes.  I wrote one once that was 3000 lines of shell, about twice as
large as any single module in the program it was configuring &#8212;
and this was not unusual.</p><p>The community eventually said &#8220;Enough!&#8221; and various
people set out to write tools that would automate away part or all of
the process of maintaining makefiles. These tools generally tried to
address two issues:</p><p>One issue is <span class="emphasis"><em>portability</em></span>. Makefile
generators are commonly built to run on many different hardware
platforms and Unix variants. They generally try to deduce things about
the local system (including everything from machine word size up to
which tools, languages, service libraries, and even document
formatters it has available). They then try to use those deductions to
write makefiles that exploit the local system's facilities and
compensate for its quirks.</p><p>The other issue is <span class="emphasis"><em>dependency
derivation</em></span>. It's possible to deduce a great deal about the
dependencies of a collection of C sources by analyzing the sources
themselves (especially by looking at what include files they use and
share). Many makefile generators do this in order to mechanically
generate <i>make</i> dependencies.</p><p>Each different makefile generator tackles these objectives in a
slightly different way. Probably a dozen or more generators have
been attempted, but most proved inadequate or too difficult to drive
or both, and only a few are still in live use. We'll survey the major
ones here. All are available as open-source software on the
Internet.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2987736"/><i>makedepend</i></h4></div></div><p>Several small tools have tackled the rule automation part of the
problem exclusively. This one, distributed along with the X windowing
system from MIT<a id="id2987751" class="indexterm"/>, is the fastest and most useful and comes
preinstalled under all modern Unixes, including all
Linuxes<a id="id2987761" class="indexterm"/>.</p><p><i>makedepend</i> takes a collection of
C<a id="id2987780" class="indexterm"/> sources and
generates dependencies for the corresponding <tt>.o</tt>
files from their <tt>#include</tt> directives. These can be
appended directly to a makefile, and in fact makedepend is defined to
do exactly that.</p><p><i>makedepend</i> is useless for anything
but C projects. It doesn't try to solve more than one piece of the
makefile-generation problem. But what it does it does quite
well.</p><p><i>makedepend</i> is sufficiently documented
by its manual page. If you type <b>man makedepend</b> at a
terminal window you will quickly learn what you need to know about
invoking it.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2987839"/><i>Imake</i></h4></div></div><p><i>Imake</i> was written in an attempt to
mechanize makefile generation for the X window
system<a id="id2987858" class="indexterm"/>. It
builds on <i>makedepend</i> to tackle both the
dependency-derivation and portability problems.</p><p><i>Imake</i> system effectively replaces
conventional makefiles with Imakefiles. These are written in a more
compact and powerful notation which is (effectively) compiled into
makefiles. The compilation uses a rules file which is system-specific
and includes a lot of information about the local environment.</p><p><i>Imake</i> is well suited to X's
particular portability and configuration challenges and universally
used in projects that are part of the X distribution. However, it has
not achieved much popularity outside the X developer community. It's
hard to learn, hard to use, hard to extend, and produces generated
makefiles of mind-numbing size and complexity.</p><p>The <i>Imake</i> tools will be available on
any Unix that supports X, including Linux<a id="id2987918" class="indexterm"/>. There has been one heroic
effort [<a href="apb.html#DuBois" title="[DuBois]">DuBois</a>] to make the mysteries of
<i>Imake</i> comprehensible to non-X-programming
mortals. These are worth learning if you are going to do X
programming.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2987944"/><i>autoconf</i></h4></div></div><p><i>autoconf</i> was written by people who
had seen and rejected the <i>Imake</i>
approach. It generates per-project <tt>configure</tt>
shellscripts that are like the old-fashioned custom script
configurators. These <tt>configure</tt> scripts can
generate makefiles (among other things).</p><p><i>Autoconf</i> is focused on portability
and does no built-in dependency derivation at all. Although it is
probably as complex as <i>Imake</i>, it is much
more flexible and easier to extend. Rather than relying on a
per-system database of rules, it generates
<tt>configure</tt> shell code that goes out and searches
your system for things.</p><p>Each <tt>configure</tt> shellscript is built from a
per-project template that you have to write, called <tt>configure.in</tt>. Once generated, though, the
<tt>configure</tt> script will be self-contained and can
configure your project on systems that don't carry
autoconf(1)
itself.</p><p>The <i>autoconf</i> approach to makefile
generation is like imake's in that you start by writing a makefile
template for your project. But <i>autoconf</i>'s
<tt>Makefile.in</tt> files are basically just makefiles
with placeholders in them for simple text substitution; there's no
second notation to learn. If you want dependency derivation, you must take
explicit steps to call
makedepend(1)
or some similar tool &#8212; or use
automake(1).</p><p><i>autoconf</i> is documented by an on-line
manual in the GNU <i>info</i> format. The source scripts
of autoconf are available from the FSF<a id="id2988122" class="indexterm"/> archive site, but are
also preinstalled on many Unix and Linux<a id="id2988132" class="indexterm"/> versions. You should be able to
browse this manual through your Emacs's help system.</p><p>Despite its lack of direct support for dependency derivation,
and despite its generally ad-hoc approach, in mid-2003
<i>autoconf</i> is clearly the most popular of the
makefile generators, and has been for some years. It has eclipsed
<i>Imake</i> and driven at least one major
competitor (<i>metaconfig</i>) out of use.</p><p>A reference, <i>GNU Autoconf, Automake and
Libtool</i> is available [<a href="apb.html#Vaughan" title="[Vaughan]">Vaughan</a>]. We'll have
more to say about <i>autoconf</i>, from a slightly
different angle, in <a href="portabilitychapter.html" title="Chapter 17. Portability">Chapter 17</a>.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2988205"/><i>automake</i></h4></div></div><p><i>automake</i> is an attempt to add
