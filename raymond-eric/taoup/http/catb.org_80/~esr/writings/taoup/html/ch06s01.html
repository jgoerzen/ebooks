philosophy.  But in this chapter we'll begin by looking at several
Unix designs that exhibit transparency and discoverability, and
attempt to draw lessons from them only after all have been
presented.  Each major point of the analysis in the latter half of this
chapter draws on several of these, and the arrangement avoids forward
references to case studies the reader hasn't seen yet.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="audacity"/>Case Study: <i>audacity</i></h3></div></div><p>First, we'll look at an example of transparency in UI design.  It
is <i>audacity</i>, an open-source editor for
sound files that runs on Unix systems, Mac OS X, and Windows.
Sources, downloadable binaries, documentation, and screen shots are
available at the <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">project site</a>.</p><p>This program supports cutting, pasting, and editing of audio
samples. It supports multitrack editing and mixing.  The UI is
superbly simple; the sound waveforms are shown in the
<i>audacity</i> window. The image of the
waveform can be cut and pasted; operations on that image are directly
reflected in the audio sample as soon as they are performed.</p><div class="figure"><a id="id2909476"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 6.1. Screen shot of <i>audacity</i>.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/audacity.png" alt="Screen shot of audacity."/></div></div><p>Multitrack editing is supported in the simplest possible way;
the screen splits into multiple per-track displays in a spatial
relationship that conveys their concurrency and makes it easy to 
match features by inspection.  Tracks can be dragged right or
left with the mouse to change their relative timing.</p><p>Several features of this UI are subtly excellent and worthy of
emulation: the large, easily visible and clickable operation 
buttons with distinguishing colors, the presence of an undo command
that removes most of the risk from experimentation, the volume slider
that makes softness/loudness visually obvious in its shape.</p><p>But these are details.  The central virtue of this program is
that it has a superbly transparent and natural user interface, one that
erects as few barriers between the user and the sound file as
possible.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="fetchmail_v"/>Case Study: <i>fetchmail</i>'s <tt>-v</tt> option</h3></div></div><a id="id2909581" class="indexterm"/><p><i>fetchmail</i><a id="id2909598" class="indexterm"/>
is a network gateway program. Its main purpose is to translate between
POP3 or IMAP remote-mail protocols and the Internet's native SMTP
protocol for email exchange. It is in extremely widespread use on Unix
machines that use intermittent SLIP or PPP connections to Internet
service providers, and as such probably touches an appreciable
fraction of the Internet's mail traffic.</p><p><i>fetchmail</i> has no fewer than 60
command-line options (which, as we'll establish later in this book, is
probably too many), and a number of other options that are settable
from the run-control file but not from the command line.  Of all
these, the most important &#8212; by far &#8212; is
<tt>-v</tt>, the verbose option.</p><p>When <tt>-v</tt> is on, <i>fetchmail</i>
dumps each one of its POP, IMAP, and SMTP transactions to standard
output as they happen.  A developer can actually see the code doing
protocol with remote mailservers and the mail transport program it
forwards to, in real time.  Users can send session transcripts with
their bug reports. <a href="#fetchmail_session" title="Example 6.1. An example fetchmail -v transcript.">Example 6.1</a> shows a

<i>fetchmail</i> is doing discoverable (by letting you
see the protocol exchanges).  This is <span class="emphasis"><em>immensely</em></span>
useful.  I considered it so important that I wrote special code to
mask account passwords out of <tt>-v</tt> transaction dumps so
that they could be passed around and posted without anyone having to
remember to edit sensitive information out of them.</p><p>This turned out to be a good call.  At least eight out of ten
problems reported get diagnosed within seconds of a knowledgeable
person's eyes seeing a session transcript.  There are several
knowledgeable people on the fetchmail mailing list &#8212; in fact,
because most bugs are easy to diagnose, I seldom have to
handle them myself.</p><p>Over the years, <i>fetchmail</i> has
acquired a reputation as a rather bulletproof program.  It can be
misconfigured, but it very seldom outright breaks.  Betting that this
has nothing to do with the fact that the exact circumstances of eight
out of ten bugs are rapidly discoverable would not be smart.</p><p>We can learn from this example.  The lesson is this:  Don't
let your debugging tools be mere afterthoughts or treat them as
throwaways.  They are your windows into the code; don't just knock
crude holes in the walls, finish and glaze them.  If you plan to 
keep the code maintained, you're always going to need to let light
into it.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2909841"/>Case Study: GCC</h3></div></div><p>GCC, the GNU C compiler used on most modern Unixes, is perhaps
an even better example of engineering for transparency.  GCC is
organized as a sequence of processing stages knit together by a 
driver program.  The stages are: preprocessor, parser, code 
generator, assembler, and linker.</p><p>Each of the first three stages takes in a readable textual
format and emits a readable textual format (the assembler has to emit
and the linker to accept binary formats, pretty much by definition).
With various command-line options of the
gcc(1)
driver, you can see not just the results after C preprocessing, after
assembly generation, and after object code generation &#8212; but you
can also monitor the results of many intermediate steps in parsing and
code generation.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>This is exactly the structure of cc, the first (PDP-11) C

</span></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div><p>There are many benefits of this organization.  One that is
particularly important for GCC is regression
testing.<sup>[<a id="id2909913" href="#ftn.id2909913">60</a>]</sup>  Because most
of the various intermediate formats are textual, deviations from
expected results in a regression test are easily spotted and analyzed
using simple textual diff operations on the intermediate results;
there is no need for specialist dump-analysis tools that may well
harbor their own bugs, and in any case would represent an additional
maintenance burden.</p><p>The design pattern to extract from this example is that the
driver program has monitoring switches that merely (but sufficiently)
expose the textual data flows among the components.  As with
<i>fetchmail's</i> <tt>-v</tt> option,
these options are not afterthoughts; they are designed in for
discoverability.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2909954"/>Case Study: <i>kmail</i></h3></div></div><p><i>kmail</i> is the GUI mailreader
distributed with the KDE environment.  The
<i>kmail</i> UI is tastefully and well designed,
with many good features including automatic display of enclosed images
in a MIME<a id="id2909983" class="indexterm"/> multipart and
support for PGP key encryption/decryption.  It is friendly to
end-users &#8212; my beloved but nontechie wife uses and
enjoys it.</p><p>Many mail user agents make one gesture in the direction of
discoverability<a id="id2909999" class="indexterm"/>
by having a command that toggles display of all the mail headers,
as opposed to a select few like From and Subject.  The UI of
<i>kmail</i> takes this a long step
further.</p><p>A running <i>kmail</i> displays status
notifications in a one-line subwindow at the bottom of its window, in
small type over a steel-gray background clearly modeled on the
Netscape/Mozilla status bar.  When you open a mailbox, for example,
the status bar displays counts of total and unread messages.  The
visual presentation is unobtrusive; it is easy to ignore the
notifications, but also easy to focus on them if you want to.</p><div class="figure"><a id="id2910036"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 6.2. Screen shot of <i>kmail</i>.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/kmail.png" alt="Screen shot of kmail."/></div></div><p>The <i>kmail</i> GUI is good user-interface
design. It's informative, but not distracting; it gets around the
reason we adduce in <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter 11. Interfaces">Chapter 11</a> that the best policy for Unix tools
operating normally is usually silence.  The authors showed excellent
taste in borrowing the look and feel of the browser status bar.</p><p>But the extent of the <i>kmail</i>
developers' tastefulness will not become clear until you have to
troubleshoot an installation that is having trouble sending mail.  If
you watch closely during the send, you will observe that each line of
the SMTP transaction with the remote mail transport is echoed into the
<i>kmail</i> status bar as it happens.</p><p>The <i>kmail</i> developers neatly avoid a
trap that often makes GUI programs like
<i>kmail</i> a terrible pain in a troubleshooter's
fundament.  Most design teams with kmail's objectives would have
suppressed those messages entirely, fearing that they would give Aunt
Tillie a touch of the vapors that would drive her back to the
meretricious pseudo-simplicity of a Windows box.</p><p>Instead, they designed for transparency &#8212; they made the
transaction messages show, but also made them visually easy to ignore.
By getting the presentation right, they managed to please both Aunt
Tillie and her geeky nephew Melvin who fixes her computer problems.
This was brilliant; it's a technique other GUI interfaces could and
should emulate.</p><p>Ultimately, of course, the visibility of those messages is good
for Aunt Tillie, because they mean Melvin is far less likely to throw
up his hands in frustration while trying to solve her email
problems.</p><p>The lesson here is clear.  Dumbing down your UI is only the
half-smart thing to do.  The really smart thing is to find a way 
to leave the details accessible, but make them unobtrusive.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2910193"/>Case Study: SNG</h3></div></div><p>The program <i>sng</i> translates between
PNG<a id="id2910209" class="indexterm"/> format and an
all-text representation of it (SNG or Scriptable Network Graphics

editor.  Run on a PNG file, it produces an SNG file; run on an SNG
file, it recovers the equivalent PNG.  The transformation is 100%
faithful and lossless in both directions.</p><p>In syntactic style, SNG resembles CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),
another language for controlling presentation of graphics; this makes
at least a gesture in the direction of the Rule of Least

obscure PNG<a id="id2910288" class="indexterm"/> chunk types
that are not necessarily supported by conventional graphics editors.
Rather than writing special-purpose code to grovel through the PNG
binary format, the user can simply flip an image into an all-text
representation, edit that, and massage it back.  Another potential
application is in making images amenable to version control; under
most version-control systems, text files are much easier to manage
than binary blobs, and diff operations on SNG representations actually
have some possibility of yielding useful information.</p><p>The gains here go beyond the time not spent writing
special-purpose code for manipulating binary PNGs, however. The code
of the <i>sng</i> program itself is not especially
transparent, but it promotes transparency in larger systems of
programs by making the entire contents of PNGs
discoverable<a id="id2910322" class="indexterm"/>.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2910334"/>Case Study: The Terminfo Database</h3></div></div><p>The terminfo database is a collection of descriptions of
video-display terminals.  Each entry describes the escape sequences 
that perform various manipulations on the terminal screen, such as
inserting or deleting lines, erasing from the cursor position to end
of line or screen, or beginning and ending screen highlights such
as reverse video, underline, or blink.</p><p>The terminfo database is primarily used by the
curses(3)
libraries.  These underlie the &#8220;roguelike&#8221; interface
style we discuss in <a href="interfacechapter.html" title="Chapter 11. Interfaces">Chapter 11</a>, and some very widely used programs such
as
mutt(1),
lynx(1),
and
slrn(1).
Though the terminal emulators such as
xterm(1)
that run on today's bitmapped displays all have capabilities that are
minor variations on those of the ANSI X3.64 standard and the venerable
VT100 terminal, there is still enough variation that hardwiring ANSI
capabilities into applications would be a bad idea.  Terminfo is also
worth studying because problems that are logically similar to the one
it addressed arise constantly in managing other kinds of peripheral
hardware that doesn't have a standard way to report their own
capabilities.</p><p>The design of terminfo benefits from experience with an earlier
capability format called termcap.  The database of termcap
descriptions lived in a textual format in one big file, 
<tt>/etc/termcap</tt>; though this format is 
now obsolete, your Unix system almost certainly includes a
copy.</p><p>Normally, the key used to look up your terminal type entry is
the environment variable <tt>TERM</tt>, which for purposes of
this case study is set by magic.<sup>[<a id="id2910448" href="#ftn.id2910448">61</a>]</sup>  Applications that
use terminfo (or termcap) pay a small penalty in startup lag; when the
curses(3)
library initializes itself, it has to look up the entry corresponding
to <tt>TERM</tt> and load the entry into memory.</p><p>Experience with termcap showed that the startup penalty was
dominated by the time required to parse the textual representation of
capabilities. Accordingly, terminfo entries are binary structure dumps
that can be marshaled and unmarshaled more quickly.  There is a master
textual format for the entire database, the terminfo capability file.
That file (or individual entries) can be compiled to binary form with
the terminfo compiler
tic(1);
binary entries can be decompiled to the editable text format by
infocmp(1).</p><p>The design superficially contradicts the advice we gave in <a href="textualitychapter.html" title="Chapter 5. Textuality">Chapter 5</a> against binary
caches, but this is actually the extreme case in which that's a good
tactic.  Edits to the text masters are very rare &#8212; in fact,
Unixes normally ship with the terminfo database precompiled and the
text master serving primarily as documentation.  Thus, the
synchronization and inconsistency problems that would normally
militate against this approach almost never arise.</p><p>The designers of terminfo could have optimized for speed
in a second way.  The entire database of binary entries could have
been put in some kind of big opaque database file.  What they actually did
instead was more clever and more in the Unix spirit.  Terminfo entries
live in a directory hierarchy, usually on modern Unixes under
<tt>/usr/share/terminfo</tt>.  Consult the
terminfo(5)
man page to find the location on your system.</p><p>If you look in the terminfo directory, you'll see subdirectories
named by single printable characters.  Under each of these are the
entries for each terminal type that has a name beginning with that
letter.  The goal of this organization was to avoid having to do a
linear search of a very large directory; under more modern Unix
file systems, which represent directories with B-trees or other
structures optimized for fast lookup, the subdirectories won't be
necessary.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>I found that even on a fairly modern Unix, splitting a big directory up
into subdirectories can improve performance substantially.  It was tens
of thousands of files, an authorized-user database for a big educational
institution, on a late-model DEC Alpha running DEC's Unix.  (Subdirectories
named by first and last letter of name &#8212; e.g., &quot;johnson&quot; would be in
directory &quot;j_n&quot; &#8212; worked best of the schemes we tested.  Using the first
two letters wasn't nearly as good, because there were a lot of
systematically-generated names which differed only toward the end.)
This may just say that sophisticated directory indexing is still not as
common as it should be... but even so, that makes an organization which
works well without it more portable than one which requires it.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">
<span class="author">Henry Spencer</span>
<a id="id2910600" class="indexterm"/>
</span></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div><p>Thus, the cost of opening a terminfo entry is two file system
lookups and a file open.  But since mining the same entry from one
big database would have required a lookup and open for the database,
the incremental cost for terminfo's organization is at most one
file system lookup.  Actually, it's less than that; it's the cost
difference between one file system lookup and whatever retrieval method
the one big database would have used.  This is probably marginal, and
quite tolerable once per application at startup time.</p><p>Terminfo uses the file system itself as a simple hierarchical
database.  This is a superb bit of constructive laziness, obeying the
Rule of Economy and the Rule of Transparency.  It means that all the
ordinary tools for navigating, examining and modifying the file system
can be used to navigate, examine, and modify the terminfo database; no
special ones (other than
tic(1)
and
infocmp(1)
for packing and unpacking the individual records) need to be written
and debugged.  It also means that work on speeding up database access
would be work on speeding up the file system itself, tuning that would
benefit many more applications than just users of
curses(3).</p><p>There is one additional advantage of this organization that
doesn't come up in the terminfo case; you get to use Unix's
permissions mechanism rather than having to invent your own
access-control layer with its own bugs.  This falls out as a
consequence of adopting the &#8220;everything is a file&#8221;
philosophy of Unix rather than trying to fight it.</p><p>The terminfo directory layout is rather space-inefficient
on most Unix file systems.  The entries are usually between 400 and
1400 bytes long, but file systems normally allocate a minimum of 4K 
for every nonempty disk file. The designers accepted this cost
for the same reason they chose a packed binary format, to
cut the startup latency of terminfo-using programs to a minimum.  Disk 
capacity for constant price has exploded over a thousandfold since,
tending to vindicate that decision.</p><p>The contrast with the formats used by the Microsoft Windows

registry files is instructive.  Registries are property databases used
by both Windows itself and applications.  Each registry lives in one
big file.  Registries contain a mix of text and binary data that
requires specialized editing tools.  The one-big-file approach leads,
among other things, to the notorious &#8216;registry creep&#8217;
phenomenon; average access time rises without bound as new entries are
added.  Because there is no standard API for editing the registry
provided by the system, applications use ad-hoc code to edit it
themselves, making it notoriously subject to corruption that can lock
up the entire system.</p><p>Using the Unix file system as a database is a tactic other
applications with simple database requirements might do well to emulate.
Good reasons not to do it are more likely to have to do with the
database keys not naturally looking like filenames than they are with
any performance problems.  In any case, it's the sort of good fast
hack that can be very useful in prototyping.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2914115"/>Case Study: Freeciv Data Files</h3></div></div><p>Freeciv is an open-source strategy game inspired by Sid Meier's
classic <i>Civilization II</i>.  In it, each player
begins with a wandering band of neolithic nomads and builds a
civilization. Player civilizations may explore and colonize the world,
fight wars, engage in trade, and research technological advances.
Some players may actually be artificial intelligences; solitaire play
against these can be challenging.  One wins either by conquering the
world or by being the first player to reach a technology level sufficient
to get a starship to Alpha Centauri.  Sources and documentation are
available at the <a href="http://www.freeciv.org/" target="_top">project
site</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="id2914147"/><p class="title"><b>Figure 6.3. Main window of a Freeciv game.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/freeciv.png" alt="Main window of a Freeciv game."/></div></div><p>In <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter 7. Multiprogramming">Chapter 7</a>
we'll exhibit the Freeciv strategy game as an example of client-server
partitioning, with the server maintaining shared state and the client
concentrating on GUI presentation.  But this game has another notable
architectural feature; much of the game's fixed data, rather than
being wired into the server code, is expressed in a property registry
read in by the game server at startup time.</p><p>The game's registry files are written in a textual data-file
format that assembles text strings (with associated text and numeric
properties) into various internal lists of important data (such as
nations and unit types) in the game server.  The minilanguage has an
include directive, so game data can be broken up into semantic units
(different files) that are each separately editable.  This design
choice has been carried through to such an extent that it's possible
to define new nations and new unit types simply by creating new
declarations in the data files, without touching the server code at
all.</p><p>The Freeciv server's startup parsing has an interesting feature
that creates something of a conflict between two of Unix's design
rules, and is therefore worth closer examination.  The server ignores
property names it doesn't know how to use. This makes it possible to
declare properties that the server doesn't yet use without breaking
the startup parsing. It means that development of the game data
(policy) and the server engine (mechanism) can be cleanly separated.
On the other hand, it also means startup parsing won't catch simple
misspellings of attribute names.  This quiet failure seems to violate
the Rule of Repair.</p><p>To resolve this conflict, notice that it's the server's job to
<span class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the registry data, but the task of carefully
error-checking that data could be handed off to another program to be run
by human editors each time the registry is modified.  One Unix
solution would be a separate auditing program that analyzes either
a machine-readable specification of the ruleset format or the source
of the server code to determine the set of properties it uses, parses
the Freeciv registry to determine the set of properties it provides,
and prepares a difference report.<sup>[<a id="id2914267" href="#ftn.id2914267">62</a>]</sup></p><p>The aggregate of all Freeciv data files is functionally similar
to a Windows registry, and even uses a syntax resembling the textual
portions of registries.  But the creep and corruption problems we
noted with the Windows registry don't crop up here because no program
(either within or outside the Freeciv suite)
<span class="emphasis"><em>writes</em></span> to these files.  It's a read-only
registry edited only by the game's maintainers.</p><p>The performance impact of data-file parsing is minimized because
for each file the operation is performed only once, at either 
client or server startup time.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2909913" href="#id2909913">60</a>] </sup>Regression testing is a method for detecting
