over the right way to partition by multiprogramming.  Some obsolete

questionable utility have been imported from other operating systems

TCP/IP<a id="id2923386" class="indexterm"/> (born 1980) and
the ubiquitous networking of the 1990s and later.  Anonymous pipes,
redirection, and shellout have been in Unix since very early days, but
the history of Unix is littered with the corpses of APIs tied to
obsolescent IPC and networking models, beginning with the <tt>mx()</tt> facility that appeared in Version 6 (1976)
and was dropped before Version 7 (1979).</p><p>Eventually BSD sockets<a id="id2923415" class="indexterm"/> won out as IPC was unified with
networking.  But this didn't happen until after fifteen years of
experimentation that left a number of relics behind.  It's useful to
know about these because there are likely to be references to them in
your Unix documentation that might give the misleading impression that
they're still in use. These obsolete methods are described in more detail
in <i>Unix Network Programming</i> [<a href="apb.html#Stevens90" title="[Stevens90]">Stevens90</a>].</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#160;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>The real explanation for all the dead IPC facilities in old AT&amp;T

on the System V shared memory facility we described earlier.</p><p>Programs that cooperate using System V IPC usually define
shared protocols based on exchanging short (up to 8K) binary messages.
The relevant manual pages are
msgctl(2)
and friends.  As this style has been largely superseded by text
protocols passed between sockets, we do not give an example
here.</p><p>The System V IPC facilities are present in
Linux<a id="id2923513" class="indexterm"/>
and other modern Unixes. However, as they are a legacy feature, they
are not exercised very often. The Linux version is still known to have
bugs as of mid-2003.  Nobody seems to care enough to fix them.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id2923528"/>Streams</h4></div></div><p>Streams networking was invented for Unix Version 8 (1985) by
Dennis Ritchie<a id="id2923538" class="indexterm"/>. A re-implementation called STREAMS (yes,
it is all-capitals in the documentation) first became available in the
3.0 release of System V Unix (1986)<a id="id2923549" class="indexterm"/>.  The STREAMS facility provided a
full-duplex interface (functionally not unlike a BSD
socket<a id="id2923559" class="indexterm"/>, and like
sockets, accessible through normal
read(2)
and
write(2)
operations after initial setup) between a user process and a specified
device driver in the kernel.  The device driver might be hardware such
as a serial or network card, or it might be a software-only
pseudodevice set up to pass data between user processes.</p><p>An interesting feature of both streams and
STREAMS<sup>[<a id="id2923595" href="#ftn.id2923595">76</a>]</sup> is that it is possible to push
protocol-translation modules into the kernel's processing path, so
that the device the user process &#8216;sees&#8217; through the
full-duplex channel is actually filtered.  This capability could be
used, for example, to implement a line-editing protocol for a terminal
device.  Or one could implement protocols such as IP or TCP without
wiring them directly into the kernel.</p><p>Streams originated as an attempt to clean up a messy feature of the
kernel called &#8216;line disciplines&#8217; &#8212; alternative modes
of processing character streams coming from serial terminals and early
local-area networks.  But as serial terminals faded from view,
Ethernet LANs became ubiquitous, and TCP/IP drove out other protocol
stacks and migrated into Unix kernels, the extra flexibility provided
by STREAMS had less and less utility.  In 2003, System V
Unix<a id="id2923628" class="indexterm"/> still
supports STREAMS, as do some System V/BSD<a id="id2923637" class="indexterm"/> hybrids such as Digital Unix and
Sun Microsystems' Solaris.</p><p>Linux<a id="id2923650" class="indexterm"/> and other open-source Unixes have
effectively discarded STREAMS. Linux kernel modules and libraries are
available from the <a href="http://www.gcom.com/home/linux/lis/" target="_top">LiS</a> project, but (as
of mid-2003) are not integrated into the stock Linux kernel.  They
will not be supported under non-Unix operating systems.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2923675"/>Remote Procedure Calls</h3></div></div><p>Despite occasional exceptions such as NFS (Network File System)
and the GNOME project, attempts to import CORBA, ASN.1, and other
forms of remote-procedure-call interface have largely failed &#8212;
these technologies have not been naturalized into the Unix
culture.</p><p>There seem to be several underlying reasons for this.  One is
that RPC interfaces are not readily
discoverable<a id="id2923695" class="indexterm"/>;
that is, it is difficult to query these interfaces for their
capabilities, and difficult to monitor them in action without building
single-use tools as complex as the programs being monitored (we
examined some of the reasons for this in <a href="transparencychapter.html" title="Chapter&#160;6.&#160;Transparency">Chapter&#160;6</a>). They have the same version skew
problems as libraries, but those problems are harder to track because
they're distributed and not generally obvious at link time.</p><p>As a related issue, interfaces that have richer type signatures
also tend to be more complex, therefore more brittle. Over time, they
tend to succumb to ontology creep as the inventory of types that get
passed across interfaces grows steadily larger and the individual types
more elaborate.  Ontology creep is a problem because structs are more
likely to mismatch than strings; if the ontologies of the programs on
each side don't exactly match, it can be very hard to teach them to
communicate at all, and fiendishly difficult to resolve bugs.  The
most successful RPC applications, such as the Network File System, 
are those in which the application domain naturally has only a
few simple data types.</p><p>The usual argument for RPC is that it permits
&#8220;richer&#8221; interfaces than methods like text streams
&#8212; that is, interfaces with a more elaborate and
application-specific ontology of data types. But the Rule of
Simplicity applies!  We observed in <a href="modularitychapter.html" title="Chapter&#160;4.&#160;Modularity">Chapter&#160;4</a> that one of the functions of interfaces
is as choke points that prevent the implementation details of modules
from leaking into each other.  Therefore, the main argument in favor
of RPC is also an argument that it increases global complexity rather
than minimizing it.</p><p>With classical RPC, it's too easy to do things in a complicated
and obscure way instead of keeping them simple.  RPC seems to
encourage the production of large, baroque, over-engineered systems with
obfuscated interfaces, high global complexity, and serious
version-skew and reliability problems &#8212; a perfect example of
thick glue layers run amok.</p><p>Windows COM and DCOM are perhaps the archetypal examples of how
bad this can get, but there are plenty of others.  Apple abandoned
OpenDoc, and both CORBA and the once wildly hyped Java
RMI<a id="id2923778" class="indexterm"/> have
receded from view in the Unix world as people have gained field
experience with them.  This may well be because these methods don't
actually solve more problems than they cause.</p><p>Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Robbert van Renesse have given us a
detailed analysis of the general problem in <i>A Critique of
the Remote Procedure Call Paradigm</i> [<a href="apb.html#Tanenbaum-VanRenesse" title="[Tanenbaum-VanRenesse]">Tanenbaum-VanRenesse</a>], a paper which should serve as a
strong cautionary note to anyone considering an architecture based on
RPC.</p><p>All these problems may predict long-term difficulties for the
relatively few Unix projects that use RPC.  Of these projects, perhaps
the best known is the GNOME desktop effort.<sup>[<a id="id2923816" href="#ftn.id2923816">77</a>]</sup>  These problems also contribute to the
notorious security vulnerabilities of exposing NFS servers. </p><p>Unix tradition, on the other hand, strongly favors
transparent<a id="id2923832" class="indexterm"/> and
discoverable<a id="id2923840" class="indexterm"/>
interfaces. This is one of the forces behind the Unix culture's
continuing attachment to IPC through textual protocols.  It is often
argued that the parsing overhead of textual protocols is a performance
problem relative to binary RPCs &#8212; but RPC interfaces tend to
have latency problems that are far worse, because (a) you can't
readily anticipate how much data marshaling and unmarshaling a given
call will involve, and (b) the RPC model tends to encourage
programmers to treat network transactions as cost-free.  Adding even
one additional round trip to a transaction interface tends to add
enough network latency to swamp any overhead from parsing or
marshaling.</p><p>Even if text streams were less efficient than RPC, the
performance loss would be marginal and linear, the kind better
addressed by upgrading your hardware than by expending development
time or adding architectural complexity. Anything you might lose in
performance by using text streams, you gain back in the ability to
design systems that are simpler &#8212; easier to monitor, to model,
and to understand.</p><p>Today, RPC and the Unix attachment to text streams are
converging in an interesting way, through protocols like XML-RPC and
SOAP. These, being textual and transparent, are more palatable to Unix
programmers than the ugly and heavyweight binary serialization formats
they replace.  While they don't solve all the more general
problems pointed out by Tanenbaum and van Renesse, they do in some
ways combine the advantages of both text-stream and RPC worlds.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2923889"/>Threads &#8212; Threat or Menace?</h3></div></div><p>Though Unix developers have long been comfortable with
computation by multiple cooperating processes, they do not have a
native tradition of using threads (processes that share their entire
address spaces).  These are a recent import from elsewhere, and the
fact that Unix programmers generally dislike them is not merely
accident or historical contingency.</p><p>From a complexity-control point of view, threads are a bad
substitute for lightweight processes with their own address spaces;
the idea of threads is native to operating systems with expensive
process-spawning and weak IPC facilities. </p><p>By definition, though daughter threads of a process typically
have separate local-variable stacks, they share the same global
memory. The task of managing contentions and critical regions in this
shared address space is quite difficult and a fertile source of global
complexity and bugs. It can be done, but as the complexity of one's
locking regime rises, the chance of races and deadlocks due to
unanticipated interactions rises correspondingly.</p><p>Threads are a fertile source of bugs because they can too easily
know too much about each others' internal states.  There is no
automatic encapsulation, as there would be between processes with
separate address spaces that must do explicit IPC to communicate.
Thus, threaded programs suffer from not just ordinary contention
problems, but from entire new categories of timing-dependent bugs that
are excruciatingly difficult to even reproduce, let alone fix.</p><p>Thread developers have been waking up to this problem.  Recent
thread implementations and standards show an increasing concern with
providing thread-local storage, which is intended to limit problems
arising from the shared global address space.  As threading APIs move
in this direction, thread programming starts to look more and more
like a controlled use of shared memory.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top">&#160;</td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Threads often prevent abstraction.

in the design of Unix kernels for symmetric multiprocessing.
As your resource-locking gets finer-grained, latency due to locking
overhead can increase fast enough to swamp the gains from locking
less core memory.</p><p>One final difficulty with threads is that threading standards
still tend to be weak and underspecified as of
mid-2003. Theoretically conforming libraries for Unix standards
such as POSIX<a id="id2924049" class="indexterm"/> threads
(1003.1c) can nevertheless exhibit alarming differences in behavior
across platforms, especially with respect to signals, interactions
with other IPC methods, and resource cleanup times.  Windows and
classic MacOS have native threading models and interrupt facilities
quite different from those of Unix and will often require considerable
porting effort even for simple threading cases.  The upshot is that
you cannot count on threaded programs to be portable.</p><p>For more discussion and a lucid contrast with event-driven
