a background so implicit that many Unix practitioners do not notice 
it, any more than fish notice the water they swim in.  It is the
presence of frameworks.</p><p>Small, sharp tools in the Unix style have trouble sharing data,
unless they live inside a framework that makes communication among
them easy. Emacs is such a framework, and
<span class="emphasis"><em>unified management of shared context</em></span> is what the
optional complexity of Emacs is buying.
The practical impact of unified management of shared context is that
the user is not burdened with low-level naming and resource-management
issues.</p><p>In old-school Unix, the only framework was pipelines,
redirection, and the shell; the integration was done with scripts, and
the shared context was (essentially) the file system itself.  But that
was not the end of evolution.</p><p>Emacs unifies the file system with a world of text buffers and
helper processes, largely leaving the shell framework behind.  Wily is
also about buffers and helpers, but incorporates the shell framework
into itself. Modern desktop environments provide a communication
framework for GUIs, also leaving the shell framework behind.  Each
framework has strengths and weaknesses of its own.  Frameworks become
homes to ecologies of tools &#8212; the shell to shellscripts, Emacs
to Lisp modes, and desktop environments to flocks of GUIs
communicating both via drag and drop and by more esoteric means such
as object brokers.</p><p>This suggests a Rule of Minimality: <span class="emphasis"><em>Choose the shared
context you want to manage, and build your programs as small as those
boundaries will allow.</em></span> This is &#8220;as simple as
possible, but no simpler&#8221;, but it focuses attention on the
choice of shared context.  It applies not just to frameworks, but
to applications and program systems.</p><p>It is, however, all too easy to get sloppy about how large your
shared context needs to be. The pressure behind Zawinski's Law is the
tendency of applications to want to share context for convenience.
It's easy to end up carrying around too much weight, too many
assumptions, and to write programs that are over-complex, bloated, and
huge.  The paradigmatic example in the 1990s was the way that the
mailto: URL induced the growth of huge mail clients
embedded in Web browsers.</p><p>The corrective to this tendency comes straight from the
old-school Unix hymnbook.  It is the Rule of Parsimony:
<span class="emphasis"><em>Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration
that nothing else will do</em></span>&#8212;that is, when attempts to
partition the problem have been made and failed. This maxim implies an
astringent skepticism about large programs, and a strategy for
avoiding them: look for the small-program solution first. If a single
small program won't do the job, try building a toolkit of cooperating
small programs within an existing framework to attack it. Only if both
approaches fail are you free (in the Unix tradition) to build a large
program (or a new framework) without feeling you have failed the
design challenge.</p><p>When you do write a framework, remember the Rule of Separation.
Frameworks should be mechanism, and have as little policy as possible.
In most cases, that is no policy at all. Factor as much behavior as
possible into modules that use the framework.  One of the benefits of
writing or reusing a framework is that it can help you separate what
would otherwise be big lumps of policy into separate modules, modes,
or tools &#8212; pieces that can be usefully recombined with
others.</p><p>These rules are valuable heuristics, but the tension at the
heart of the Unix tradition does not resolve neatly into a set of
<span class="foreignphrase"><i>a-priori</i></span> prescriptions for optimal size
of any given project.  Circumstances alter cases, and exercising good
judgment and good taste is what software designers are for.  As in
Soto Zen, the journey <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> the destination;
enlightenment has to be rediscovered in every day of practice.</p></div></body></html>
