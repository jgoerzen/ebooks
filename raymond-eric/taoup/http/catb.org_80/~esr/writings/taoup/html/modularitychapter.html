has evolved as programmers have had to manage ever-increasing levels
of complexity.  In the beginning, everything was one big lump of
machine code.  The earliest procedural languages brought in the notion
of partition by subroutine.  Then we invented service libraries to
share common utility functions among multiple programs. Next, we
invented separated address spaces and communicating processes.  Today we
routinely distribute program systems across multiple hosts separated
by thousands of miles of network cable.</p><p>The early developers of Unix were among the pioneers in software
modularity.  Before them, the Rule of Modularity was computer-science
theory but not engineering practice.  In <i>Design
Rules</i> [<a href="apb.html#Baldwin-Clark" title="[Baldwin-Clark]">Baldwin-Clark</a>], a path-breaking
study of the economics of modularity in engineering design, the
authors use the development of the computer industry as a case study 
and argue that the Unix community was in fact the first to
systematically apply modular decomposition to production software, as
opposed to hardware.  Modularity of hardware has of course been one
of the foundations of engineering since the adoption of standard 
screw threads in the late 1800s.</p><p>The Rule of Modularity bears amplification here: The only way to
write complex software that won't fall on its face is to build it out
of simple modules connected by well-defined interfaces, so that most
problems are local and you can have some hope of fixing or optimizing
a part without breaking the whole.</p><p>The tradition of being careful about modularity and of paying
close attention to issues like
orthogonality<a id="id2896019" class="indexterm"/>
and compactness are still much deeper in the bone among Unix
programmers than elsewhere.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Early Unix programmers became good at modularity because they had to
be.  An OS is one of the most complicated pieces of code around.  If
it is not well structured, it will fall apart.  There were a couple of
early failures at building Unix that were scrapped.  One can blame the
early (structureless) C for this, but basically it was because the OS
was too complicated to write.  We needed both refinements in tools (like C 
structures) and good practice in using them (like Rob Pike's rules for 
programming) before we could tame that complexity.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

languages of 1970 function calls were expensive, either because call
semantics were complicated (PL/1.  Algol) or because the compiler was
optimizing for other things like fast inner loops at the expense of
call time.  Thus, code tended to be written in big lumps.  Ken and
several of the other early Unix developers knew modularity was a good
idea, but they remembered PL/1 and were reluctant to write small
functions lest performance go to hell.</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Dennis Ritchie encouraged modularity by telling all and sundry that
function calls were really, really cheap in C.  Everybody started
writing small functions and modularizing.  Years later we found out
that function calls were still expensive on the PDP-11, and VAX code 
was often spending 50% of its time in the CALLS instruction.  Dennis
had lied to us!  But it was too late; we were all hooked...</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

modularize at the subroutine level within programs.  Some learn the
art of doing this at the module or abstract-data-type level and call
that &#8216;good design&#8217;.  The
design-patterns<a id="id2896126" class="indexterm"/> movement is making a noble effort to
push up a level from there and discover successful design abstractions
that can be applied to organize the large-scale structure of
programs.</p><p>Getting better at all these kinds of problem partitioning is a
worthy goal, and many excellent treatments of them are available
elsewhere.  We shall not attempt to cover all the issues relating to
modularity within programs in too much detail: first, because that is
a subject for an entire volume (or several volumes) in itself; and
second, because this is a book about the art of
<span class="emphasis"><em>Unix</em></span> programming.</p><p>What we will do here is examine more specifically what the Unix
tradition teaches us about how to follow the Rule of Modularity.  In
this chapter, our examples will live within process units.  Later, in
<a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter 7. Multiprogramming">Chapter 7</a>, we'll
examine the circumstances under which partitioning programs into
multiple cooperating processes is a good idea, and discuss more
specific techniques for doing that partitioning.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="design.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="design.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch04s01.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Part II. Design </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Encapsulation and Optimal Module Size</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
