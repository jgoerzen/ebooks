end user, having heard tales of the Master's wisdom, came to him for
guidance.</p><p>He bowed three times to Master Foo. &#8220;I wish to learn the
Great Way of Unix&#8221;, he said &#8220;but the command line
confuses me&#8221;.</p><p>Some of the onlooking neophytes began to mock the end user,
calling him &#8220;clueless&#8221; and saying that the Way of
Unix is only for those of discipline and intelligence.</p><p>The Master held up a hand for silence, and called the most
obstreperous of the neophytes who had mocked forward, to where
he and the end user sat.</p><p>&#8220;Tell me&#8221;, he asked the neophyte, &#8220;of the
code you have written and the works of design you have
uttered&#8221;.</p><p>The neophyte began to stammer out a reply, but fell silent.</p><p>Master Foo turned to the end-user. &#8220;Tell me&#8221;, he
inquired, &#8220;why do you seek the Way?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I am discontent with the software I see around
me&#8221;, the end user replied. &#8220;It neither performs reliably
nor pleases the eye and hand.  Having heard that the Unix way, though
difficult, is superior, I seek to cast aside all snares and
delusions&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;And what do you do in the world&#8221;, asked Master Foo,
&#8220;that you must strive with software?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I am a builder&#8221;, the end user replied, &#8220;Many
of the houses of this town were made under my chop&#8221;.</p><p>Master Foo turned back to the neophyte.  &#8220;The housecat may
mock the tiger&#8221;, said the master, &#8220;but doing so will not
make his purr into a roar&#8221;.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the neophyte was enlightened.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="unix-nature.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="unix_koans.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="co01.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Master Foo Discourses on the Unix-Nature </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Colophon</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
