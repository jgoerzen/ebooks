more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand
lines of C&#8221;.</p><p>The programmer, who was very proud of his mastery of C, said:
&#8220;How can this be?  C is the language in which the very kernel of
Unix is implemented!&#8221;</p><p>Master Foo replied: &#8220;That is so. Nevertheless, there is
more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand
lines of C&#8221;.</p><p>The programmer grew distressed.  &#8220;But through the C
language we experience the enlightenment of the Patriarch Ritchie!  We
become as one with the operating system and the machine, reaping
matchless performance!&#8221;</p><p>Master Foo replied: &#8220;All that you say is true. But there
is still more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten
thousand lines of C&#8221;.</p><p>The programmer scoffed at Master Foo and rose to depart.  But
Master Foo nodded to his student Nubi, who wrote a line of shell
script on a nearby whiteboard, and said: &#8220;Master programmer,
consider this pipeline.  Implemented in pure C, would it not span ten
thousand lines?&#8221;</p><p>The programmer muttered through his beard, contemplating what
Nubi had written.  Finally he agreed that it was so.</p><p>&#8220;And how many hours would you require to implement and
debug that C program?&#8221; asked Nubi.</p><p>&#8220;Many&#8221;, admitted the visiting programmer.
&#8220;But only a fool would spend the time to do that when so many
more worthy tasks await him&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;And who better understands the Unix-nature?&#8221;
Master Foo asked. &#8220;Is it he who writes the ten thousand
lines, or he who, perceiving the emptiness of the task, gains merit by
not coding?&#8221;</p><p>Upon hearing this, the programmer was enlightened.</p></div></body></html>
