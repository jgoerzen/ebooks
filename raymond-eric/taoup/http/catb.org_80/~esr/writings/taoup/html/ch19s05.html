unrestricted rights to copy, use, modify, and redistribute modified
copies as long as a copy of the copyright and license terms is
retained in all modified versions.  But when you accept this
license you do give up the right to sue the maintainers.</p><p>You can find a template for the standard X Consortium license at

rights to copy, use, modify, and redistribute modified copies as long
as a copy of the copyright and license terms is retained in all
modified versions, and an acknowledgment is made in advertising or
documentation associated with the package.  Grantee has to give up
the right to sue the maintainers.</p><p>The original BSD license is the best-known license of this kind.
Among parts of the free-software culture that trace their lineages
back to BSD Unix<a id="id3014913" class="indexterm"/>,
this license is used even on a lot of free software that was written
thousands of miles from
Berkeley<a id="id3014923" class="indexterm"/>.</p><p>It is also not uncommon to find minor variants of the BSD
license that change the copyright holder and omit the advertising
requirement (making it effectively equivalent to the MIT license).
Note that in mid-1999 the Office of Technology Transfer of the
University of California rescinded the advertising clause in the BSD
license. So the license on the BSD software has been relaxed in
exactly this way.  Should you choose the BSD approach, we strongly
recommend that you use the new license (without advertising clause)
rather than the old.  That requirement was dropped because it led to
significant legal and procedural complications over what constituted
advertising.</p><p>You can find a BSD license template at the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html" target="_top">OSI

rights to copy, use, and locally modify. It allows redistribution of
modified binaries, but restricts redistribution of modified sources in
ways intended to protect the interests of the authors and the
free-software community.</p><p>The Artistic License, devised for Perl<a id="id3014982" class="indexterm"/> and widely used in the Perl developer
community, is of this kind. It requires modified files to contain
&#8220;prominent notice&#8221; that they have been altered. It also
requires people who redistribute changes to make them freely available
and make efforts to propagate them back to the free-software
community.</p><p>You can find a copy of the Artistic License at the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.html" target="_top">OSI

or &#8220;Lesser&#8221; GPL) is the single most widely used
free-software license. Like the Artistic License, it allows
redistribution of modified sources provided the modified files bear
&#8220;prominent notice&#8221;.</p><p>The GPL requires that any program containing parts that are under
GPL be wholly GPLed. (The exact circumstances that trigger this
requirement are not perfectly clear to everybody.)</p><p>These extra requirements actually make the GPL more restrictive
than any of the other commonly used licenses. (Larry Wall developed
the Artistic License to avoid them while serving many of the same
objectives.)</p><p>You can find a pointer to the GPL, and instructions about how to

source, but may be linked with closed-source modules or extensions. It
requires that the distributed software (&quot;Covered Code&quot;)
remain open, but permits add-ons called through a defined API to
remain closed.</p><p>You can find a template for the MPL at the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MPL-1.1.html" target="_top">OSI
