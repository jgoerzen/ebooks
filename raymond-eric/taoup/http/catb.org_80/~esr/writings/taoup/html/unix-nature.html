called SCO holds true dominion over Unix&#8221;.</p><p>Master Foo nodded.</p><p>The student continued, &#8220;Yet we are also told that the firm
called OpenGroup also holds true dominion over Unix&#8221;.</p><p>Master Foo nodded.</p><p>&#8220;How can this be?&#8221; asked the student.</p><p>Master Foo replied:</p><p>&#8220;SCO indeed has dominion over the code of Unix, but the
code of Unix is not Unix.  OpenGroup indeed has dominion over the name
of Unix, but the name of Unix is not Unix&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;What, then, is the Unix-nature?&#8221; asked the student.</p><p>Master Foo replied:</p><p>&#8220;Not code.  Not name.  Not mind.  Not things.  Always changing,
yet never changing&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;The Unix-nature is simple and empty.  Because it is
simple and empty, it is more powerful than a typhoon&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;Moving in accordance with the law of nature, it unfolds
inexorably in the minds of programmers, assimilating designs to its
own nature. All software that would compete with it must become
like to it; empty, empty, profoundly empty, perfectly void,
hail!&#8221;</p><p>Upon hearing this, the student was enlightened.</p></div></body></html>
