Graphical User Interface</h2></div></div><p>One evening, Master Foo and Nubi attended a gathering of
programmers who had met to learn from each other.  One of the
programmers asked Nubi to what school he and his master belonged. Upon
being told they were followers of the Great Way of Unix, the
programmer grew scornful.</p><p>&#8220;The command-line tools of Unix are crude and
backward&#8221;, he scoffed.  &#8220;Modern, properly designed
operating systems do everything through a graphical user
interface&#8221;.</p><p>Master Foo said nothing, but pointed at the moon.  A nearby
dog began to bark at the master's hand.</p><p>&#8220;I don't understand you!&#8221; said the programmer.</p><p>Master Foo remained silent, and pointed at an image of the Buddha.
Then he pointed at a window.</p><p>&#8220;What are you trying to tell me?&#8221; asked the
programmer.</p><p>Master Foo pointed at the programmer's head.
Then he pointed at a rock.</p><p>&#8220;Why can't you make yourself clear?&#8221; demanded the
programmer.</p><p>Master Foo frowned thoughtfully, tapped the the programmer
twice on the nose, and dropped him in a nearby trashcan.</p><p>As the programmer was attempting to extricate himself from
the garbage, the dog wandered over and piddled on him.</p><p>At that moment, the programmer achieved enlightenment.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="methodology-consultant.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="unix_koans.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="zealot.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Master Foo and the
