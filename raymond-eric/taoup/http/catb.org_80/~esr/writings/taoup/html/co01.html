book.  Drafts were typeset from XML-DocBook master files created with
<i>GNU Emacs</i>.  PostScript generation was
performed with Tim Waugh's <i>xmlto</i>, Norman Walsh's XSL stylesheets,
Daniel Veillard's <i>xsltproc</i>, Sebastian
Rahtz's PassiveTeX macros, the TeTeX distribution of Donald Knuth's
<i>TeX</i> typesetter, and Thomas Rokicki's
<i>dvips</i> postprocessor.  All the diagrams were
composed by the author using <i>pic2graph</i> driving
<i>gpic</i> and <i>grap2graph</i> driving Ted Faber's
<i>grap</i> implementation (<i>grap2graph</i> was written by the author for
this project and is now part of the <i>groff</i>
distribution). The entire toolchain was hosted by stock Red Hat
Linux.</p><p>The cover art is a composite of two images from the original
<i>Zen Comics</i> by Ioanna Salajan.  It was adapted
and colored mainly by Jerry Votta, but the author and GIMP had a hand
in the work.</p></div></body></html>
