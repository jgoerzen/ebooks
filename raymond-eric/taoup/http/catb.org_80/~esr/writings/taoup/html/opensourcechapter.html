Unix's history; it flourished when its practices most closely
approximated open source, and stagnated when they did not.  We then
asserted in <a href="reusechapter.html" title="Chapter 16. Reuse">Chapter 16</a> that
open-source development tools tend to be of high quality.  We'll begin
this chapter by sketching an explanation of how and why open-source
development works.  Most of its behaviors are simply intensifications
of long-established Unix-tradition practices.</p><p>We'll then descend from realm of abstraction and describe some
of the most important folk customs that Unix has picked up from the
open-source community &#8212; in particular, the community-evolved
guidelines for what a good source-code release looks like.  Many of
these customs could be profitably adopted by developers on other modern
operating systems as well.</p><p>We'll describe these customs on the assumption that you are
developing open source; most are still good ideas even if you are
writing proprietary software.  The open-source assumption is also
historically appropriate, because many of these customs found their
way back into proprietary Unix shops via ubiquitous open-source tools
like
patch(1),
<i>Emacs</i>, and GCC<a id="id3009490" class="indexterm"/>.</p></div></body></html>
