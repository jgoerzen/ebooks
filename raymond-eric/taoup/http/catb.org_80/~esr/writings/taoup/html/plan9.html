It was designed
by the research group at Bell Labs that built Unix and called
&#8216;Plan 9 from Bell Labs&#8217;.<sup>[<a id="id3015199" href="#ftn.id3015199">154</a>]</sup>  Plan 9 was an attempt to do Unix over
again, better.</p><p>The central design challenge the designers attempted to meet in
Plan 9 was integrating graphics and ubiquitous networking into a
comfortable Unix-like framework. They kept the Unix choice to mediate
access to as many system services as possible through a single big
file-hierarchy name space.  In fact, they improved on it; many
facilities that under Unix are accessed through various ad-hoc
interfaces like BSD sockets,
fcntl(2),
and
ioctl(2)
are in Plan 9 accessed through ordinary read and write operations on
special files analogous to device files.  For portability and ease of
access, almost all device interfaces are textual rather than binary.
Most system services (including, for example, the window system) are
<i>file servers</i> containing special files or
directory trees representing the served resources.  By representing
all resources as files, Plan 9 turns the problem of accessing
resources on different servers into the problem of accessing files on
different servers.</p><p>Plan 9 combined this more-Unix-than-Unix file model with a new
concept: private name spaces.  Every user (in fact, every
process) can have its own view of the system's services by creating
its own tree of file-server mounts.  Some of the file server mounts
will have been manually set up by the user, and others automatically
set up at login time.  So (as the <i>Plan 9 from Bell
Labs</i> survey paper points out)
&#8220;<tt>/dev/cons</tt> always refers to your terminal
device and <tt>/bin/date</tt> to the correct version of
the date command to run, but which files those names represent depends
on circumstances such as the architecture of the machine executing
<b>date</b>&#8221;.</p><p>The single most important feature of Plan 9 is that all mounted
file servers export the same file-system-like interface, regardless of
the implementation behind them.  Some might correspond to local file
systems, some to remote file systems accessed over a network, some to
instances of system servers running in user space (like the window
system or an alternate network stack), and some to kernel interfaces.
To users and client programs, all these cases look alike.</p><p>One of the examples from the Plan 9 survey paper is the way FTP
access to remote sites is implemented.  There is no
ftp(1)
command under Plan 9.  Instead there is an
<i>ftpfs</i> fileserver, and each FTP connection
looks like a file system mount. <i>ftpfs</i>
automatically translates open, read, and write commands on files and
directories under the mount point into FTP protocol transactions.
Thus, all ordinary file-handling tools such as
ls(1),
mv(1)
and
cp(1)
simply work, both underneath the FTP mount point and across the
boundaries with the rest of the user's view of the namespace.  The only
difference the user (or his scripts and programs) will notice is
retrieval speed.</p><p>Plan 9 has much else to recommend it, including the reinvention
of some of the more problematic areas of the Unix system-call
interface, the elimination of superuser, and many other interesting
rethinkings. Its pedigree is impeccable, its design elegant, and it
exposes some significant errors in the design of Unix.  Unlike most
efforts at a second system, it produced an architecture that was in
many ways simpler and more elegant than its predecessor. Why didn't it
take over the world?</p><p>One could argue for a lot of specific reasons &#8212; lack of
any serious effort to market it, scanty documentation, much confusion
and stumbling over fees and licensing.  For those unfamiliar with Plan
9, it seemed to function mainly as a device for generating interesting
papers on operating-systems research.  But Unix itself had previously
surmounted all these sorts of obstacles to attract a dedicated
following that spread it worldwide.  Why didn't Plan 9?</p><p>The long view of history may tell a different story, but in
2003 it looks like Plan 9 failed simply because it fell short of
being a compelling enough improvement on Unix to displace its
ancestor.  Compared to Plan 9, Unix creaks and clanks and has obvious
rust spots, but it gets the job done well enough to hold its position.
There is a lesson here for ambitious system architects: the most
dangerous enemy of a better solution is an existing codebase that is
just good enough.</p><p>Some Plan 9 ideas have been absorbed into modern Unixes,
particularly the more innovative open-source versions.  FreeBSD has a
<tt>/proc</tt> file system modeled exactly on
that of Plan 9 that can be used to query or control running processes.
FreeBSD's
rfork(2)
and Linux's
clone(2)
system calls are modeled on Plan 9's
rfork(2).
Linux's <tt>/proc</tt> file system, in addition
to presenting process information, holds a variety of synthesized Plan
9-like device files used to query and control kernel internals using
predominantly textual interfaces.  Experimental 2003 versions of
Linux are implementing per-process mount points, a long step toward
Plan 9's private namespaces.  The various open-source Unixes are all
moving toward systemwide support for UTF-8, an encoding actually
invented for Plan 9.<sup>[<a id="id3015486" href="#ftn.id3015486">155</a>]</sup></p><p>It may well be that over time, much more of Plan 9 will work its
way into Unix as various portions of Unix's architecture slide into
senescence.  This is one possible line of development for Unix's 
future.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id3015199" href="#id3015199">154</a>] </sup>The name is a
