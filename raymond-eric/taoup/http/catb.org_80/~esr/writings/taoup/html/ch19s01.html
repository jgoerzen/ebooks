and fixing bugs &#8212; unlike, say, implementing a particular
algorithm &#8212; is a task that lends itself well to being split into
multiple parallel subtasks.  Exploration of the neighborhood of
possibilities near a prototype design also parallelizes well.  With
the right technological and social machinery in place, development
teams that are loosely networked and very large can do astoundingly
good work.</p><p>Astoundingly, that is, if you are carrying around the mental
habits developed by people who treat process secrecy and proprietary
control as a given. From <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i>
[<a href="apb.html#Brooks" title="[Brooks]">Brooks</a>] until the rise of
Linux<a id="id3009532" class="indexterm"/>,
the orthodoxy in software engineering was all about small, closely
managed teams within heavyweight organizations like corporations and
government. The practice was of <span class="emphasis"><em>large</em></span> teams
closely managed.</p><p>The early Unix community, before the
AT&amp;T<a id="id3009553" class="indexterm"/> divestiture, was a paradigmatic
example of open source in action.  While the pre-divestiture Unix code
was technically and legally proprietary, it was treated as a commons
within its user/developer community.  Volunteer efforts were
self-directed by the people most strongly motivated to solve problems.
From these choices many good things flowed.  Indeed, the technique of
open-source development evolved as an unconscious folk practice in the
Unix community for more than a quarter century, many years before it was
analyzed and labeled in the late 1990s (See <i>The Cathedral
and the Bazaar</i> [<a href="apb.html#Raymond01" title="[Raymond01]">Raymond01</a>] and <i>Understanding
Open Source Software Development</i> [<a href="apb.html#Feller-Fitzgerald" title="[Feller-Fitzgerald]">Feller-Fitzgerald</a>].</p><p>In retrospect, it is rather startling how oblivious we all were
to the implications of our own behavior. Several people came very
close to understanding the phenomenon; Richard Gabriel in his
&#8220;Worse Is Better&#8221;<a id="id3009606" class="indexterm"/> paper from 1990 [<a href="apb.html#Gabriel" title="[Gabriel]">Gabriel</a>]
is the best known, but one can find prefigurations in Brooks [<a href="apb.html#Brooks" title="[Brooks]">Brooks</a>] (1975) and as far back as Vyssotsky and
Corbató's meditations on the Multics design (1965). I failed to
get it over more than twenty years of observing software development,
before being awakened by Linux in the mid-1990s.  This experience
should make any thoughtful and humble person wonder what other
important unifying concepts are still implicit in our behavior and
lurking right under our collective noses, hidden not by their
complexity but by their very simplicity.</p><p>The rules of open-source development are simple:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Let the source be open.</em></span> 
Have no secrets.  Make the code and the process that produces it
public. Encourage third-party peer review.  Make sure that others 
can modify and redistribute the code freely.  Grow the co-developer
community as big as you can.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Release early, release often.</em></span> A rapid
release tempo means quick and effective feedback.  When each
incremental release is small, changing course in response to
real-world feedback is easier.</p><p>Just make sure your first release builds, runs, and demonstrates
promise.  Usually, an initial version of an open-source program
demonstrates promise by doing at least some portion of its final job,
sufficient to show that the initiator can actually continue the
project.  For example, an initial version of a word processor might
support typing in text and displaying it on the screen. </p><p>A first release that cannot be compiled or run can kill a
project (as, famously, almost happened to the Mozilla browser).
Releases that cannot compile suggest that the project developers will
be unable to complete the project, Also, non-working programs are
difficult for other developers to contribute to, because they cannot
easily determine if any change they made improved the program or not.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Reward contribution with praise.</em></span> 
If you can't give your co-developers material rewards, 
give psychological ones.  Even if you can, remember that people will
often work harder for reputation than they would for gold.</p></li></ol></div><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>A corollary of rule 2 is that individual releases should not be
momentous events, with many promises attached and much preparation.
It's important to ruthlessly streamline your release process, so that
you <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> do frequent releases painlessly.  A setup
where all other work must stop during release preparation is a
terrible mistake.  (Notably, if you're using CVS or something similar,
releases in preparation should be branches off the main line of
development, so that they don't block main-line progress.)  To sum up,
don't treat releases as big special events; make them part of normal
routine.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">
<span class="author">Henry Spencer</span>
<a id="id3007670" class="indexterm"/>
</span></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div><p>Remember that the reason for frequent releases is to shorten and
speed the feedback loop connecting your user population to your
developers.  Therefore, resist thinking of the next release as a
polished jewel that cannot ship until everything is perfect.  Don't
make long wish lists.  Make progress incrementally, admit and advertise
current bugs, and have confidence that perfection will come with
time.  Accept that you will go through dozens of point releases on the
way, and don't get upset as the version numbers mount.</p><p>Open-source development uses large teams of programmers
distributed over the Internet and communicating primarily through
email and Web documents.  Typically, most contributors to any given
project are volunteers contributing in order to be rewarded by the
increased usefulness of the software to them, and by reputation
incentives.  A central individual or core group steers the project;
other contributors may drop in and drop out sporadically.  To
encourage casual contributors, it is important to avoid erecting
social barriers between them and the core team.  Minimize the core
team's privileged status, and work hard to keep the boundaries
inconspicuous.</p><p>Open-source projects follow the Unix-tradition advice of
automating wherever possible.  They use the
patch(1)
tool to pass around incremental changes.  Many projects (and all large
ones) have network-accessible code repositories using version-control
systems like CVS (recall the discussion in <a href="toolschapter.html" title="Chapter 15. Tools">Chapter 15</a>). Use of automated bug- and patch-tracking
systems is also common.</p><p>In 1997, almost nobody outside the hacker culture understood
that it was even possible to run a large project this way, let alone
get high-quality results.  In 2003 this is no longer news;
projects like Linux<a id="id3007763" class="indexterm"/>,
Apache<a id="id3007775" class="indexterm"/>, and Mozilla
have achieved both success and high public visibility.</p><p>Abandoning the habit of secrecy in favor of process
transparency<a id="id3007790" class="indexterm"/> and peer review was
the crucial step by which alchemy became chemistry.  In the same way,
it is beginning to appear that open-source development may signal the
long-awaited maturation of software development as a
discipline.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="opensourcechapter.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="opensourcechapter.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch19s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 19. Open Source </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Best Practices for Working with Open-Source Developers</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
