conventions that is either formally standardized or sufficiently well
established by practice that there are standard service libraries to
handle marshaling and unmarshaling it.</p><p>Unix has evolved or adopted metaformats suitable for a wide range
of applications. It is good practice to use one of these (rather than
an idiosyncratic custom format) wherever possible.  The benefits begin
with the amount of custom parsing and generation code that you may be
able to avoid writing by using a service library.  But the most
important benefit is that developers and even many users will instantly 
recognize these formats and feel comfortable with them, which reduces
the friction costs of learning new programs.</p><p>In the following discussion, when we refer to &#8220;traditional
Unix tools&#8221; we are intending the combination of
grep(1),
sed(1),
awk(1),
tr(1),
and
cut(1)
for doing text searches and transformations.
Perl<a id="id2901857" class="indexterm"/> and other
scripting languages<a id="id2901866" class="indexterm"/> tend to have good native support for
parsing the line-oriented formats that these tools encourage.</p><p>Here, then, are the standard formats that can serve you as models.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2901882"/>DSV Style</h3></div></div><p>DSV stands for <i>Delimiter-Separated
Values</i>.  Our first case study in textual metaformats was
the <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file, which is a DSV format with
colon as the value separator.  Under Unix, colon is the default
separator for DSV formats in which the field values may contain
whitespace.</p><p><tt>/etc/passwd</tt> format (one record 
per line, colon-separated fields) is very traditional under Unix
and frequently used for tabular data.  Other classic examples 
include the <tt>/etc/group</tt> file describing security 
groups and the <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> file used to control
startup and shutdown of Unix service programs at different run levels
of the operating system. </p><p>Data files in this style are expected to support inclusion of
colons in the data fields by backslash escaping.  More generally,
code that reads them is expected to support record continuation by
ignoring backslash-escaped newlines, and to allow embedding
nonprintable character data by C-style backslash escapes.</p><p>This format is most appropriate when the data is tabular,
keyed by a name (in the first field), and records are typically
short (less than 80 characters long).  It works well with 
traditional Unix tools.</p><p>One occasionally sees field separators other than the colon,
such as the pipe character | or even an ASCII NUL.  Old-school Unix
practice used to favor tabs, a preference reflected in the defaults
for
cut(1)
and
paste(1);
but this has gradually changed as format designers became aware of the
many small irritations that ensue from the fact that tabs and spaces
are not visually distinguishable.</p><p>This format is to Unix what CSV (comma-separated value) format 
is under Microsoft Windows and elsewhere outside the Unix world.
CSV (fields separated by commas, double quotes used to escape 
commas, no continuation lines) is rarely found under Unix.</p><p>In fact, the Microsoft version of CSV is a textbook example of
how <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to design a textual file format. Its
problems begin with the case in which the separator character (in this
case, a comma) is found inside a field. The Unix way would be to
simply escape the separator with a backslash, and have a double escape
represent a literal backslash.  This design gives us a single special case
(the escape character) to check for when parsing the file, and only a
single action when the escape is found (treat the following character
as a literal). The latter conveniently not only handles the separator
character, but gives us a way to handle the escape character and
newlines for free. CSV, on the other hand, encloses the entire field
in double quotes if it contains the separator.  If the field contains
double quotes, it must also be enclosed in double quotes, and the
individual double quotes in the field must themselves be repeated
twice to indicate that they don't end the field.</p><p>The bad results of proliferating special cases are twofold.
First, the complexity of the parser (and its vulnerability to bugs) is
increased.  Second, because the format rules are complex and
underspecified, different implementations diverge in their handling of
edge cases.  Sometimes continuation lines <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
supported, by starting the last field of the line with an unterminated
double quote &#8212; but only in some products!  Microsoft has
incompatible versions of CSV files between its own applications, and
in some cases between different versions of the same application
(Excel being the obvious example here).</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2902039"/>RFC 822 Format</h3></div></div><p>The RFC 822 metaformat derives from the textual format of
Internet electronic mail messages; RFC 822 is the principal Internet RFC
describing this format (since superseded by RFC 2822).  MIME
(Multipurpose Internet Media Extension)<a id="id2902052" class="indexterm"/> provides
a way to embed typed binary data within RFC-822-format messages.  (Web
searches on either of these names will turn up the relevant
standards.)</p><p>In this metaformat, record attributes are stored one per line,
named by tokens resembling mail header-field names and terminated with
a colon followed by whitespace.  Field names do not contain
whitespace; conventionally a dash is substituted instead. The
attribute value is the entire remainder of the line, exclusive of
trailing whitespace and newline.  A physical line that begins with tab
or whitespace is interpreted as a continuation of the current logical
line. A blank line may be interpreted either as a record terminator or
as an indication that unstructured text follows.</p><p>Under Unix, this is the traditional and preferred textual
metaformat for attributed messages or anything that can be closely
analogized to electronic mail.  More generally, it's appropriate for
records with a varying set of fields in which the hierarchy of data is
flat (no recursion or tree structure).</p><p>Usenet news<a id="id2902092" class="indexterm"/> uses
it; so do the HTTP 1.1 (and later) formats used by the World Wide Web.
It is very convenient for editing by humans.  Traditional Unix search
tools are still good for attribute searches, though finding record
boundaries will be a little more work than in a record-per-line
format.</p><p>One weakness of RFC 822 format is that when more than one RFC
822 message or record is put in a file, the record boundaries may not
be obvious &#8212; how is a poor literal-minded computer to know where
the unstructured text body of a message ends and the next header
begins?  Historically, there have been several different conventions
for delimiting messages in mailboxes.  The oldest and most widely
supported, leading each message with a line that begins with the
string <tt>&quot;From &quot;</tt> and sender information, is not
appropriate for other kinds of records; it also requires that lines in
message text beginning with <tt>&quot;From &quot;</tt> be escaped
(typically with <tt>&gt;</tt>) &#8212; a practice which not infrequently leads
to confusion.</p><p>Some mail systems use delimiter lines consisting of control
characters unlikely to appear in messages, such as several ASCII 01
(control-A) characters in succession. The MIME standard gets around
the problem by including an explicit message length in the header, but
this is a fragile solution which is very likely to break if messages
are ever manually edited.  For a somewhat better solution, see the
record-jar style described later in this chapter.</p><p>For examples of RFC 822 format, look in your mailbox.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2902164"/>Cookie-Jar Format</h3></div></div><p>Cookie-jar format is used by the
fortune(1)
program for its database of random quotes.  It is appropriate for
records that are just bags of unstructured text.  It simply uses newline
followed by <tt>%%</tt> (or sometimes newline followed by <tt>%</tt>) as a record
separator.  <a href="#fortune" title="Example 5.3. A fortune file example.">Example 5.3</a> is an example section from a

line consisting of &quot;<tt>%%\n</tt>&quot; is more explicit and less likely to be
introduced by accident during editing (two printable characters are
better than one because it can't be generated by a single-character
typo).  In a format like this it is good practice to simply ignore
blank lines.</p><p>If your records have an unstructured text part, your record-jar
format is closely approaching a mailbox format. In this case, it's
important that you have a well-defined way to escape the record
delimiter so it can appear in text; otherwise, your record reader is
going to choke on an ill-formed text part someday.  Some technique
analogous to byte-stuffing (described later in this chapter) is
indicated.</p><p>Record-jar format is appropriate for sets of field-attribute 
associations that are like DSV files, but have a variable repertoire
of fields, and possibly unstructured text associated with them.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2907018"/>XML</h3></div></div><p>XML is a very simple syntax resembling HTML &#8212;
angle-bracketed tags and ampersand-led literal sequences.  It is about
as simple as a plain-text markup can be and yet express recursively
nested data structures.  XML is just a low-level syntax; it requires
a document type definition (such as XHTML) and associated application
logic to give it semantics.</p><p>XML is well suited for complex data formats (the sort of things
for which the old-school Unix tradition would use an RFC-822-like stanza
format) though overkill for simpler ones.  It is especially
appropriate for formats that have a complex nested or recursive
structure of the sort that the RFC 822 metaformat does not handle well.

</pre></div><p>One advantage of XML is that it is often possible to
detect ill-formed, corrupted, or incorrectly generated data through a
syntax check, without knowing the semantics of the data.</p><p>The most serious problem with XML is that it doesn't play well
with traditional Unix tools.  Software that wants to read an XML
format needs an XML parser; this means bulky, complicated programs.
Also, XML is itself rather bulky; it can be difficult to see the
data amidst all the markup.</p><p>One application area in which XML is clearly winning is in
markup formats for document files (we'll have more to say about this
in <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter 18. Documentation">Chapter 18</a>).
Tagging in such documents tends to be relatively sparse among large
blocks of plain text; thus, traditional Unix tools still work fairly
well for simple text searches and transformations.</p><p>One interesting bridge between these worlds is PYX format
&#8212; a line-oriented translation of XML that can be hacked with
traditional line-oriented Unix text tools and then losslessly
translated back to XML.  A Web search for &#8220;Pyxie&#8221; will
turn up resources.  The xmltk toolkit takes the opposite tack,
providing stream-oriented tools analogous to
grep(1)

sort(1)
for filtering XML documents; Web search for
&#8220;xmltk&#8221; to find it.</p><p>XML can be a simplifying choice or a complicating one.  There is
a lot of hype surrounding it, but don't become a fashion victim by either
adopting or rejecting it uncritically. Choose carefully and bear the KISS

formats ought to look.  Most of these derive from one or more of the
standard Unix metaformats we've just described.  It is wise to follow these
conventions unless you have strong and specific reasons to do otherwise.</p><p>In <a href="configurationchapter.html" title="Chapter 10. Configuration">Chapter 10</a> we
will discuss a different set of conventions used for program
run-control files, but you should notice that it will share some of
these same rules (especially about the lexical level, the rules by
which characters are assembled into tokens).</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>One record per newline-terminated line, if
possible.</em></span> This makes it easy to extract records with
text-stream tools.  For data interchange with other operating systems, 
it's wise to make your file-format parser indifferent to whether 
the line ending is LF or CR-LF. It's also conventional to ignore
trailing whitespace in such formats; this protects against common
editor bobbles.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Less than 80 characters per line, if possible.</em></span> This
makes the format browseable in an ordinary-sized terminal window.
If many records must be longer than 80 characters, consider a
stanza format (see below).</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Use <tt>#</tt> as an introducer for comments.</em></span>
It is good to have a way to embed annotations and comments in
data files.  It's best if they're actually part of the file
structure, and so will be preserved by tools that know its format.
For comments that are not preserved during parsing, <tt>#</tt> is the 
conventional start character.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Support the backslash convention.</em></span> The least
surprising way to support embedding nonprintable control characters
is by parsing C-like backslash escapes &#8212; <tt>\n</tt> for a newline, <tt>\r</tt> for a carriage return, <tt>\t</tt> for a tab, <tt>\b</tt>
for backspace, <tt>\f</tt> for formfeed,
<tt>\e</tt> for ASCII escape (27), <tt>\nnn</tt> or <tt>\onnn</tt> or
<tt>\0nnn</tt> for the character with octal
value <tt>nnn</tt>, <tt>\xnn</tt> for the character with hexadecimal value
<tt>nn</tt>, <tt>\dnnn</tt> for the character with decimal value
<tt>nnn</tt>, <tt>\\</tt>
for a literal backslash.  A newer convention, but one worth following,
is the use of <tt>\unnnn</tt> for a hexadecimal
Unicode literal.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>In one-record-per-line formats, use colon or any run
of whitespace as a field separator.</em></span> The colon convention
seems to have originated with the Unix password file. If your fields
must contain instances of the separator(s), use a backslash as the
prefix to escape them.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Do not allow the distinction between tab and
whitespace to be significant.</em></span> This is a recipe for serious
headaches when the tab settings on your users' editors are different;
more generally, it's confusing to the eye.  Using tab alone as a field
separator is especially likely to cause problems; allowing any run of
tabs and spaces to be a field separator, on the other hand, works
well.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Favor hex over octal.</em></span> Hex-digit pairs and
quads are easier to eyeball-map into bytes and today's 32- and 64-bit
words than octal digits of three bits each; also marginally more
efficient.  This rule needs emphasizing because some older Unix tools
such as
od(1)
violate it; that's a legacy from the instruction field sizes in the
machine languages of older PDP minicomputers<a id="id2907759" class="indexterm"/>.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>For complex records, use a &#8216;stanza&#8217; format:
multiple lines per record, with a record separator line of <tt>%%\n</tt> or
<tt>%\n</tt>.</em></span> The separators make useful visual boundaries for human
beings eyeballing the file.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>In stanza formats, either have one record field per
line or use a record format resembling RFC 822 electronic-mail headers,
with colon-terminated field-name keywords leading fields.</em></span>
The second choice is appropriate when fields are often either absent
or longer than 80 characters, or when records are sparse (e.g., often
with empty fields).</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>In stanza formats, support line continuation.</em></span> 
When interpreting the file, either discard backslash followed by
whitespace or interpret newline followed by whitespace equivalently to a single
space, so that a long logical line can be folded into short (easily
editable!) physical lines. It's also conventional to ignore
trailing whitespace in these formats; this convention protects against common
editor bobbles.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Either include a version number or design the format
as self-describing chunks independent of each other.</em></span> If
there is even the faintest possibility that the format will have to be
changed or extended, include a version number so your code can
conditionally do the right thing on all versions.  Alternatively,
design the format as self-describing chunks so that you can add new
chunk types without instantly breaking old code.
</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Beware of floating-point round-off problems.</em></span>
Conversion of floating-point numbers from binary to text format and
back can lose precision, depending on the quality of the conversion
library you are using.  If the structure you are
marshaling/unmarshaling contains floating point, you should test the
conversion in both directions.  If it looks like conversion in
either direction is subject to roundoff errors, be prepared to dump
the floating-point field as raw binary instead, or a string encoding
thereof.  If you're coding in C or some language that has access to
C printf/scanf, the C99 <tt>%a</tt> specifier may solve this problem.</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Don't bother compressing or binary-encoding just part of

now use XML compressed with
zip(1)
or
gzip(1)
as a data file format.  Compressed XML combines space economy with some of the
advantages of a textual format &#8212; notably, it avoids the problem
that binary formats must often allocate space for information that may
not be used in particular cases (e.g., for unusual options or large
ranges).  But there is some dispute about this, dispute which turns on some
of the central tradeoffs discussed in this chapter.</p><p>On the one hand, experiments have shown that documents in a
compressed XML file are usually significantly smaller than the
Microsoft Word's native file format, a binary format that one might
imagine would take less space.  The reason relates to a fundamental of
the Unix philosophy: Do one thing well.  Creating a single tool
to do the compression job well is more effective than ad-hoc
compression on parts of the file, because the tool can look across all
the data and exploit <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> repetition in the
information.</p><p>Also, by separating the representation design from the
particular compression method used, you leave open the possibility of
using different compression methods in the future with no more than
minimal changes to the actual file parsing &#8212; perhaps, with no
changes at all.</p><p>On the other hand, compression does some damage to transparency.
While a human being can estimate from context whether uncompressing
the file is likely to show him anything useful, tools such as
file(1)
cannot as of mid-2003 see through the wrapping.</p><p>Some would advocate a less structured compression format &#8212;
straight
gzip(1)-compressed
XML data, say, without the internal structure and self-identifying
header chunk provided by
zip(1). While
using a format similar to that of 
zip(1)
solves the identification problem, it means that decoding such
files will be tricky for programs written in the simpler scripting
languages.</p><p>Any of these solutions (straight text, straight binary, or
compressed text) may be optimal depending on the relative weight you
give to storage economy, discoverability, or making browsing tools
as simple as possible to write.  The point of the preceding discussion
is not to advocate any one of these approaches over the others, but
rather to suggest how you can think about the options and design
tradeoffs clearly.</p><p>This having been said, the truly Unixy solution would probably
be to fix
file(1)
to see file prefixes through the compression &#8212; and, failing
that, to write a shellscript wrapper around
file(1)
that would interpret compression as a direction to apply
gunzip(1)
and take a second look.</p></div></div></body></html>
