control programs, so that options can be specified from scripts. This
is especially important for programs that function as pipes or
filters. Three conventions for how to distinguish command-line options
from ordinary arguments exist; the original Unix style, the GNU style,
and the X toolkit style.</p><p>In the original Unix tradition, command-line options are single
letters preceded by a single hyphen. Mode-flag options that do not
take following arguments can be ganged together; thus, if
<tt>-a</tt> and <tt>-b</tt> are mode options,
<tt>-ab</tt> or <tt>-ba</tt> is also correct and
enables both. The argument to an option, if any, follows it
(optionally separated by whitespace). In this style, lowercase
options are preferred to uppercase. When you use uppercase options,
it's good form for them to be special variants of the lowercase
option.</p><p>The original Unix style evolved on slow ASR-33 teletypes that made
terseness a virtue; thus the single-letter options. Holding down the
shift key required actual effort; thus the preference for lower case,
and the use of &#8220;-&#8221; (rather than the perhaps more
logical &#8220;+&#8221;) to enable options.</p><p>The GNU style uses option keywords (rather than keyword letters)
preceded by two hyphens. It evolved years later when some of the
rather elaborate GNU utilities began to run out of single-letter
option keys (this constituted a patch for the symptom, not a cure for
the underlying disease). It remains popular because GNU options are
easier to read than the alphabet soup of older styles.  GNU-style
options cannot be ganged together without separating whitespace. An
option argument (if any) can be separated by either whitespace or a
single &#8220;=&#8221; (equal sign) character.</p><p>The GNU double-hyphen option leader was chosen so that traditional
single-letter options and GNU-style keyword options could be
unambiguously mixed on the same command line. Thus, if your initial
design has few and simple options, you can use the Unix style without
worrying about causing an incompatible &#8216;flag day&#8217; if you
need to switch to GNU style later on. On the other hand, if you are
using the GNU style, it is good practice to support single-letter
equivalents for at least the most common options.</p><p>The X toolkit style, confusingly, uses a single hyphen and
keyword options. It is interpreted by X toolkits that filter out and
process certain options (such as <tt>-geometry</tt> and
<tt>-display</tt>) before handing the filtered command line to
the application logic for interpretation. The X toolkit style is not
properly compatible with either the classic Unix or GNU styles, and
should not be used in new programs unless the value of being
compatible with older X conventions seems very high.</p><p>Many tools accept a bare hyphen, not associated with any option
letter, as a pseudo-filename directing the application to read from
standard input.  It is also conventional to recognize a double hyphen
as a signal to stop option interpretation and treat all following
arguments literally.</p><p>Most Unix programming languages offer libraries that will parse
a command line for you in either classic-Unix or GNU style
(interpreting the double-hyphen convention as well).</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2948149"/>The <tt>-a</tt> to <tt>-z</tt> of Command-Line Options</h3></div></div><p>Over time, frequently-used options in well-known Unix programs
have established a loose sort of semantic standard for what various flags
might be expected to mean. The following is a list of options and
meanings that should prove usefully unsurprising to an experienced
Unix user:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><tt>-a</tt></span></dt><dd><p>All (without argument). If there is a GNU-style <tt>--all</tt>
option, for <tt>-a</tt> to be anything but a synonym for it
would be quite surprising. Examples:
fuser(1),
fetchmail(1)<a id="id2948216" class="indexterm"/>.</p><p>Append, as in
tar(1).
This is often paired with <tt>-d</tt> for delete.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-b</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Buffer or block size (with argument). Set a critical buffer
size, or (in a program having to do with archiving or managing storage
media) set a block size. Examples:
du(1),
df(1),
tar(1).</p><p>Batch. If the program is naturally interactive,
<tt>-b</tt> may be used to suppress prompts or set other
options appropriate to accepting input from a file rather than a human
operator. Example:
flex(1). </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-c</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Command (with argument). If the program is an interpreter that
normally takes commands from standard input, it is expected that the
option of a <tt>-c</tt> argument will be passed to it as a
single line of input. This convention is particularly strong for
shells and shell-like interpreters. Examples:
sh(1),
ash(1),
bsh(1),
ksh(1),
python(1).
Compare <tt>-e</tt> below.</p><p>Check (without argument). Check the correctness of the file
argument(s) to the command, but don't actually perform normal
processing. Frequently used as a syntax-check option by programs that
do interpretation of command files. Examples:
getty(1),
perl(1).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-d</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Debug (with or without argument). Set the level of debugging
messages. This one is very common.</p><p>Occasionally <tt>-d</tt> has the sense of
&#8216;delete&#8217; or &#8216;directory&#8217;.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-D</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Define (with argument). Set the value of some symbol in an
interpreter, compiler, or (especially) macro-processor-like
application. The model is the use of <tt>-D</tt> by the C<a id="id2948464" class="indexterm"/>
compiler's macro preprocessor.  This is a strong association 
for most Unix programmers; don't try to fight it.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-e</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Execute (with argument). Programs that are wrappers, or that can
be used as wrappers, often allow <tt>-e</tt> to set the program they hand off
control to. Examples:
xterm(1),
perl(1).</p><p>Edit. A program that can open a resource in either a read-only
or editable mode may allow <tt>-e</tt> to specify opening in the editable
mode. Examples:
crontab(1),
and the
get(1)
utility of the SCCS version-control system.</p><p>Occasionally <tt>-e</tt> has the sense of &#8216;exclude&#8217; or
&#8216;expression&#8217;.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-f</tt></span></dt><dd><p>File (with argument). Very often used with an argument to
specify an input (or, less frequently, output) file for programs that
need to randomly access their input or output (so that redirection via
&lt; or &gt; won't suffice). The classic example is
tar(1);
others abound.  It is also used to indicate that arguments normally
taken from the command line should be taken from a file instead;  see
awk(1)
and egrep(1)
for classic examples.
Compare <tt>-o</tt> below; often,
<tt>-f</tt> is the input-side analog of <tt>-o</tt>.</p><p>Force (typically without argument). Force some operation (such
as a file lock or unlock) that is normally performed
conditionally. This is less common.</p><p>Daemons often use <tt>-f</tt> in a way that combines
these two meanings, to force processing of a configuration file from a
nondefault location. Examples:
ssh(1),
httpd(1),
and many other daemons.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-h</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Headers (typically without argument). Enable, suppress, or
modify headers on a tabular report generated by the program.
Examples:
pr(1),
ps(1).</p><p>Help. This is actually less common than one might expect offhand
&#8212; for much of Unix's early history developers tended to think of
on-line help as memory-footprint overhead they couldn't
afford. Instead they wrote manual pages (this shaped the man-page
style in ways we'll discuss in <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter 18. Documentation">Chapter 18</a>).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-i</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Initialize (usually without argument). Set some critical
resource or database associated with the program to an initial or
empty state.  Example:
ci(1)
in RCS.</p><p>Interactive (usually without argument). Force a program that
does not normally query for confirmation to do so. There are classical
examples
(rm(1),
mv(1))
but this use is not common.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-I</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Include (with argument). Add a file or directory name to those
searched for resources by the application. All Unix compilers with any
equivalent of source-file inclusion in their languages use
<tt>-I</tt> in this sense. It would be extremely surprising to
see this option letter used in any other way.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-k</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Keep (without argument). Suppress the normal deletion of
some file, message, or resource. Examples:
passwd(1),
bzip(1),
and
fetchmail(1)<a id="id2948839" class="indexterm"/>.</p><p>Occasionally <tt>-k</tt> has the sense of
&#8216;kill&#8217;.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-l</tt></span></dt><dd><p>List (without argument). If the program is an archiver or
interpreter/player for some kind of directory or archive format, it
would be quite surprising for <tt>-l</tt> to do anything but request an item
listing.  Examples:
arc(1),
binhex(1),
unzip(1). (However,
tar(1)
and
cpio(1)
are exceptions.)</p><p>In programs that are already report generators,
<tt>-l</tt> almost invariably means &#8220;long&#8221; and
triggers some kind of long-format display revealing more detail than
the default mode.  Examples:
ls(1),
ps(1).</p><p>Load (with argument). If the program is a linker or a language
interpreter, <tt>-l</tt> invariably loads a library, in some
appropriate sense. Examples:
gcc(1),
f77(1),
emacs(1).</p><p>Login.  In programs such as
rlogin(1)
and
ssh(1)
that need to specify a network identity, <tt>-l</tt> is how you do it.</p><p>Occasionally <tt>-l</tt> has the sense of &#8216;length&#8217; or
&#8216;lock&#8217;.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-m</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Message (with argument). Used with an argument,
<tt>-m</tt> passes it
in as a message string for some logging or announcement purpose.
Examples:
ci(1),
cvs(1).</p><p>Occasionally <tt>-m</tt> has the sense of &#8216;mail&#8217;,
&#8216;mode&#8217;, or &#8216;modification-time&#8217;.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-n</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Number (with argument). Used, for example, for page number
ranges in programs such as
head(1),
tail(1),
nroff(1),
and
troff(1). Some
networking tools that normally display DNS names accept
<tt>-n</tt> as an option that causes them to display the raw
IP addresses instead;
ifconfig(1)
and
tcpdump(1)
are the archetypal examples.</p><p>Not (without argument). Used to suppress normal actions in
programs such as make(1).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-o</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Output (with argument). When a program needs to specify an
output file or device by name on the command line, the
<tt>-o</tt> option does it. Examples:
as(1),
cc(1),
sort(1). On
anything with a compiler-like interface, it would be extremely
surprising to see this option used in any other way.  Programs that
support <tt>-o</tt> often (like gcc) have logic that allows it
to be recognized after ordinary arguments as well as before.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-p</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Port (with argument). Especially used for options that specify
TCP/IP<a id="id2949254" class="indexterm"/> port numbers.
Examples:
cvs(1),
the PostgreSQL tools, the
smbclient(1),
snmpd(1),
ssh(1).</p><p>Protocol (with argument). Examples:
fetchmail(1)<a id="id2949309" class="indexterm"/>,
snmpnetstat(1).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-q</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Quiet (usually without argument). Suppress normal result or
diagnostic output. This is very common.  Examples: ci(1), co(1), 
make(1).  See also the &#8216;silent&#8217; sense of <tt>-s</tt>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-r</tt> (also <tt>-R</tt>)</span></dt><dd><p>Recurse (without argument). If the program operates on a
directory, then this option might tell it to recurse on all
subdirectories. Any other use in a utility that operated on
directories would be quite surprising. The classic example is, of
course, cp(1).</p><p>Reverse (without argument). Examples:
ls(1),
sort(1). A
filter might use this to reverse its normal translation action
(compare <tt>-d</tt>).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-s</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Silent (without argument). Suppress normal diagnostic or result
output (similar to <tt>-q</tt>; when both are supported, q
means &#8216;quiet&#8217; but <tt>-s</tt> means &#8216;utterly
silent&#8217;). Examples:
csplit(1),
ex(1),
fetchmail(1)<a id="id2949495" class="indexterm"/>.</p><p>Subject (with argument). <span class="emphasis"><em>Always</em></span> used with
this meaning on commands that send or manipulate mail or news
messages.  It is extremely important to support this, as programs
that send mail expect it. Examples: mail(1), elm(1), mutt(1).</p><p>Occasionally <tt>-s</tt> has the sense of
&#8216;size&#8217;.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-t</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Tag (with argument). Name a location or give a string for a
program to use as a retrieval key. Especially used with text editors
and viewers. Examples:
cvs(1),
ex(1),
less(1),
vi(1).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-u</tt></span></dt><dd><p>User (with argument). Specify a user, by name or numeric UID.
Examples:
crontab(1),
emacs(1),
fetchmail(1)<a id="id2949649" class="indexterm"/>,
fuser(1),
ps(1).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-v</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Verbose (with or without argument). Used to enable
transaction-monitoring, more voluminous listings, or debugging
output. Examples:
cat(1),
cp(1),
flex(1),
tar(1),
many others.</p><p>Version (without argument). Display program's version on
standard output and exit. Examples:
cvs(1),
chattr(1),
patch(1),
uucp(1). More
usually this action is invoked by <tt>-V</tt>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-V</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Version (without argument). Display program's version on
standard output and exit (often also prints compiled-in configuration
details as well). Examples: gcc(1), flex(1), hostname(1),
many others. It would be quite surprising for this switch to be
used in any other way.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-w</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Width (with argument). Especially used for specifying widths in
output formats. Examples:
faces(1),
grops(1),
od(1),
pr(1),
shar(1).</p><p>Warning (without argument). Enable warning diagnostics, or
suppress them. Examples:
fetchmail(1)<a id="id2949899" class="indexterm"/>,
flex(1),
nsgmls(1).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-x</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Enable debugging (with or without argument). Like
<tt>-d</tt>. Examples:
sh(1),
uucp(1).</p><p>Extract (with argument). List files to be extracted from an
archive or working set. Examples:
tar(1),
zip(1).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-y</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Yes (without argument). Authorize potentially destructive
actions for which the program would normally require confirmation.
Examples:
fsck(1),
rz(1).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>-z</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Enable compression (without argument). Archiving and backup
programs often use this. Examples:
bzip(1),
GNU
tar(1),
zcat(1),
zip(1),
cvs(1).</p></dd></dl></div><p>The preceding examples are taken from the
Linux<a id="id2950098" class="indexterm"/>
toolset, but should be good on most modern Unixes.</p><p>When you're choosing command-line option letters for your
program, look at the manual pages for similar tools.  Try to use the
same option letters they use for the analogous functions of your
program.  Note that some particular application areas that have
particularly strong conventions about command-line switches which you
violate at your peril &#8212; compilers, mailers, text filters,
network utilities and X software are all notable for this.  Anybody
who wrote a mail agent that used <tt>-s</tt> as anything but a
Subject switch, for example, would have scorn rightly heaped upon the
choice.</p><p>The GNU project<a id="id2950131" class="indexterm"/> recommends conventional meanings for
a few double-dash options in the GNU coding
standards.<sup>[<a id="id2950141" href="#ftn.id2950141">104</a>]</sup> It also lists long options
which, though not standardized, are used in many GNU programs.
If you are using GNU-style options, and some option you need has
a function similar to one of those listed, by all means 
obey the Rule of Least Surprise and reuse the name.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2950162"/>Portability to Other Operating Systems</h3></div></div><p>To have command-line options, you have to have a command line.
The MS-DOS family does, of course, though in Windows it's hidden by a
GUI and its use is discouraged; the fact that the option character is
normally &#8216;<tt>/</tt>&#8217; rather than &#8216;<tt>-</tt>&#8217; is merely a
detail.  MacOS classic and other pure GUI environments have no close
equivalent of command-line options.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2950141" href="#id2950141">104</a>] </sup>See the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards.html" target="_top">Gnu Coding
