software; quality, documentation, and licensing terms. We've seen
above that if you exercise a little judgment in picking through your
alternatives, you will generally find one or more of quite respectable
quality.</p><p>Documentation is often a more serious issue. Many high-quality
open-source packages are less useful than they technically ought to be
because they are poorly documentated. Unix tradition encourages a
rather hieratic style of documentation, one which (while it may
technically capture all of a package's features) assumes that the
reader is intimately familiar with the application domain and reading
very carefully. There are good reasons for this, which we'll discuss
in <a href="documentationchapter.html" title="Chapter 18. Documentation">Chapter 18</a>, but the
style can present a bit of a barrier.  Fortunately, extracting value
from it is a learnable skill.</p><p>It is worth doing a Web search for phrases including the 
software package, or topic keywords, and the string &#8220;HOWTO&#8221; or
&#8220;FAQ&#8221;. These queries will often turn up documentation
more useful to novices than the man page.</p><p>The most serious issue in reusing open-source software
(especially in any kind of commercial product) is understanding what
obligations, if any, the package's license puts upon you. In the next
two sections we'll discuss this issue in detail.</p></div></body></html>
