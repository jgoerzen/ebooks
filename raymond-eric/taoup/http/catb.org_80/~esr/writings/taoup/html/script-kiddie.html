eating the morning meal with his students.</p><p>&#8220;I hear y00 are very l33t&#8221;, he said.
&#8220;Pl33z teach m3 all y00 know&#8221;.</p><p>Master Foo's students looked at each other, confused by the
stranger's barbarous language. Master Foo just smiled and replied:
&#8220;You wish to learn the Way of Unix?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I want to b3 a wizard hax0r&#8221;, the stranger
replied, &#8220;and 0wn ever3one's b0xen&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;I do not teach that Way&#8221;, replied Master Foo.</p><p>The stranger grew agitated.  &#8220;D00d, y00 r nothing but a
p0ser&#8221;, he said.  &#8220;If y00 n00 anything, y00 wud t33ch
m3&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;There is a path&#8221;, said Master Foo, &#8220;that
might bring you to wisdom&#8221;.  The master scribbled an IP address on
a piece of paper.  &#8220;Cracking this box should pose you little
difficulty, as its guardians are incompetent.  Return and tell me 
what you find&#8221;.</p><p>The stranger bowed and left. Master Foo finished his meal.</p><p>Days passed, then months.  The stranger was forgotten.</p><p>Years later, the stranger from the land of Woot returned.</p><p>&#8220;Damn you!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I cracked that box, and
it was easy like you said.  But I got busted by the FBI and thrown
in jail&#8221;.</p><p>&#8220;Good&#8221;, said Master Foo.  &#8220;You are ready for
the next lesson&#8221;.  He scribbled an IP address on another piece
of paper and handed it to the stranger.</p><p>&#8220;Are you <span class="emphasis"><em>crazy</em></span>?&#8221; the stranger
yelled. &#8220;After what I've been through, I'm never going to break
into a computer again!&#8221;</p><p>Master Foo smiled.  &#8220;Here&#8221;, he said, &#8220;is the
beginning of wisdom&#8221;.</p><p>On hearing this, the stranger was enlightened.</p></div></body></html>
