includes a set of name to value associations (names and values are
both strings). Some of these are set manually by the user; others are
set by the system at login time, or by your shell or terminal
emulator (if you're running one).  Under Unix, environment variables
tend to carry information about file search paths, system defaults,
the current user ID and process number, and other key bits of
information about the runtime einvironment of programs.  At a shell
prompt, typing <b>set</b> followed by a newline will list
all currently defined shell variables.</p><p>In C<a id="id2942417" class="indexterm"/> and
C++<a id="id2942425" class="indexterm"/> these values
can be queried with the library function
getenv(3). Perl<a id="id2942443" class="indexterm"/> and Python<a id="id2942451" class="indexterm"/> initialize environment-dictionary
objects at startup. Other languages generally follow one of these two
models.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2942463"/>System Environment Variables</h3></div></div><p>There are a number of well-known environment variables you can
expect to find defined on startup of a program from the Unix
shell.  These (especially <tt>HOME</tt>) will often need to be evaluated
<span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> you read a local dotfile.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><tt>USER</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Login name of the account under which this session is logged in

commands).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>PATH</tt></span></dt><dd><p>The list of directories that the shell searches when looking
for executable commands to match a name.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>TERM</tt></span></dt><dd><p>Name of the terminal type of the session console or
terminal emulator window (see the terminfo case study in <a href="transparencychapter.html" title="Chapter 6. Transparency">Chapter 6</a> for background).  TERM is special in
that programs to create remote sessions over the network (such as
<i>telnet</i> and <i>ssh</i>)
are expected to pass it through and set it in the remote
session.</p></dd></dl></div><p>(This list is representative, but not exhaustive.)</p><p>The <tt>HOME</tt> variable is especially important,
because many programs use it to find the calling user's dotfiles
(others call some functions in the C<a id="id2942669" class="indexterm"/> runtime library to get the calling
user's home directory).</p><p>Note that some or all of these system environment variables may
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be set when a program is started by some
other method than a shell spawn. In particular, daemon listeners on a
TCP/IP<a id="id2942690" class="indexterm"/> socket often
don't have these variables set &#8212; and if they do, the values are
unlikely to be useful.</p><p>Finally, note that there is a tradition (exemplified by the
<tt>PATH</tt> variable) of using a colon as a separator when an
environment variable must contain multiple fields, especially when the
fields can be interpreted as a search path of some sort. Note that
some shells (notably <i>bash</i> and
<i>ksh</i>) <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> interpret
colon-separated fields in an environment variable as filenames, which
means in particular that they expand <tt>~</tt> in these fields to the user's
home directory.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2942749"/>User Environment Variables</h3></div></div><p>Although applications are free to interpret environment
variables outside the system-defined set, it is nowadays fairly
unusual to actually do so. Environment values are not really suitable
for passing structured information into a program (though it can in
principle be done via parsing of the values). Instead, modern Unix
applications tend to use run-control files and dotfiles.</p><p>There are, however, some design patterns in which user-defined
environment variables can be useful:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Application-independent preferences that need to be
shared by a large number of different programs.</em></span> This set of
&#8216;standard&#8217; preferences changes only slowly, because lots
of different programs need to recognize each one before it becomes
useful.<sup>[<a id="id2942782" href="#ftn.id2942782">102</a>]</sup> Here are the standard ones: </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><tt>EDITOR</tt></span></dt><dd><p>The name of the user's preferred editor (often used by shellout
commands).<sup>[<a id="id2942810" href="#ftn.id2942810">103</a>]</sup></p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>MAILER</tt></span></dt><dd><p>The name of the user's preferred mail user agent (often used by
shellout commands).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>PAGER</tt></span></dt><dd><p>The name of the
user's preferred program for browsing plaintext.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><tt>BROWSER</tt></span></dt><dd><p>The name of the
user's preferred program for browsing Web URLs.  This one, as of
2003, is still very new and not yet widely
implemented.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2942882"/>When to Use Environment Variables</h3></div></div><p>What both user and system environment variables have in common
is that it would be annoying to have to replicate the information they
contain in a large number of application run-control files, and
extremely annoying to have to change that information everywhere when
your preference changes.  Typically, the user sets these variables in
his or her shell session startup file.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>A value varies across several contexts that share
dotfiles, or a parent needs to pass information to multiple child
processes.</em></span> Some pieces of start-up information are expected
to vary across several contexts in which the calling user would share
common run-control files and dotfiles. For a system-level example,
consider several shell sessions open through terminal emulator windows
on an X desktop. They will all see the same dotfiles, but might have
different values of <tt>COLUMNS</tt>, <tt>LINES</tt>, and
<tt>TERM</tt>. (Old-school shell programming used this method
extensively; makefiles still do.)</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>A value varies too often for dotfiles, but doesn't
change on every startup.</em></span> A user-defined environment
variable may (for example) be used to pass a file system or Internet
location that is the root of a tree of files that the program should
play with. The CVS version-control system interprets the variable
<tt>CVSROOT</tt> this way, for example. Several newsreader
clients that fetch news from servers using the NNTP protocol interpret
the variable <tt>NNTPSERVER</tt> as the location of the server
to query.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>A process-unique override needs to be expressed in a
way that doesn't require the command-line invocation to be
changed.</em></span> A user-defined environment variable can be useful
for situations in which, for whatever reason, it would be inconvenient to
have to change an application dotfile or supply command-line options
(perhaps it is expected that the application will normally be used
inside a shell wrapper or within a makefile).  A particularly
important context for this sort of use is debugging.  Under Linux, for
example, manipulating the variable <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>
associated with the ld(1) linking loader enables you to change where
libraries are loaded from &#8212; perhaps to pick up versions that do
buffer-overflow checking or profiling.</p><p>In general, a user-defined environment variable can be an
effective design choice when the value changes often enough to make
editing a dotfile each time inconvenient, but not necessarily every
time (so always setting the location with a command-line option
would also be inconvenient).  Such variables should typically be
evaluated <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> a local dotfile and be permitted 
to override settings in it.</p><p>There is one traditional Unix design pattern that we do not
recommend for new programs. Sometimes, user-set environment variables
are used as a lightweight substitute for expressing a program
preference in a run-control file.  The venerable
nethack(1)
dungeon-crawling game, for example, reads a
<tt>NETHACKOPTIONS</tt> environment variable for user
preferences.  This is an old-school technique; modern practice would
lean toward parsing them from a <tt>.nethack</tt> or
<tt>.nethackrc</tt> run-control file.</p><p>The problem with the older style is that it makes tracking where
your preference information lives more difficult than it would be if
you knew the program had a run-control file under your home directory.
Environment variables can be set anywhere in several different shell
run-control files &#8212; under Linux these are likely to include
<tt>.profile</tt>, <tt>.bash_profile</tt>, and
<tt>.bashrc</tt> at least.  These files are cluttered and
fragile things, so as the code overhead of having an option-parser has
come to seem less significant preference information has tended to
migrate out of environment variables into dotfiles.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2947980"/>Portability to Other Operating Systems</h3></div></div><p>Environment variables have only very limited portability off
Unix. Microsoft operating systems<a id="id2947991" class="indexterm"/> have an environment-variable feature
modeled on that of Unix, and use a <tt>PATH</tt> variable as
Unix does to set the binary search path, but most of other variables
that Unix shell programmers take for granted (such as process ID or
current working directory) are not supported. Other operating systems
(including classic MacOS) generally do not have any local equivalent
of environment variables.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2942782" href="#id2942782">102</a>] </sup>Nobody knows a really graceful way to represent
this sort of distributed preference data; environment variables
probably are not it, but all the known alternatives have equally nasty
problems.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2942810" href="#id2942810">103</a>] </sup>Actually, most Unix programs first check
<tt>VISUAL</tt>, and only if that's not set will they consult
<tt>EDITOR</tt>. That's a relic from the days when people had
different preferences for line-oriented editors and visual
editors.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch10s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="configurationchapter.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch10s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Run-Control Files </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Command-Line Options</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
