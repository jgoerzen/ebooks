tell you that a sentence like &#8220;You're one of those computer
people, aren't you?&#8221; is roughly equivalent to &#8220;Look,
another amazingly mobile form of slime mold!&#8221; in the mouth of a
hotel cocktail waitress.</p></i><span>--<i><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="attribution">

</span></i></span></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Ken Arnold</em></span> was part of the group that
created the 4BSD Unix releases.  He wrote the original
curses(3)
library and was one of the authors of the original
rogue(6)
game. He is a co-author of the <i>Java Reference
Manual</i>, and one of the leading experts on Java and OO
techniques.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Steven M. Bellovin</em></span> created Usenet (with Tom
Truscott and Jim Ellis) while at University of North Carolina in 1979.
In 1982 he joined AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, where he has done
pioneering research in security, cryptography, and networking on Unix
systems and elsewhere.  He is an active member of the Internet
Engineering Task Force, and a member of the National Academy of
Engineering.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Stuart Feldman</em></span> was a member of the Bell
Labs Unix development group.  He wrote
make(1)
and
f77(1).
He is now the vice-president in charge of computing research at
IBM.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Jim Gettys</em></span> was, with Bob Scheifler and
Keith Packard, one of the principal architects of the X windowing system
in the late 1980s.  He wrote much of the X library, the X license, and
articulated the &#8220;mechanism, not policy&#8221; central credo of the X
design.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Steve Johnson</em></span> wrote
yacc(1)
and then used it to write the Portable C Compiler, which replaced the 
original DMR C and became the ancestor of most later Unix C compilers.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Brian Kernighan</em></span> has been the Unix
community's single most articulate exponent of good style.  He has
authored or coauthored several books that are indispensable classics
of the tradition, including <i>The Practice of
Programming</i>, <i>The C Programming
Language</i>, <i>The Unix Programming
Environment</i>.  While at Bell Labs, he coauthored the
awk(1)
language and had a major hand in the development of the troff family
of tools, including
eqn(1)
(co-written with Lorinda Cherry),
pic(1),
and
grap(1)
(Jon Bentley).</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>David Korn</em></span> wrote the Korn shell, the
stylistic ancestor of almost all modern Unix shell designs.  He
created UWIN, a UNIX emulator for those that are forced to use
Windows.  David has also done research in the design of file systems
and tools for source-code portability.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Mike Lesk</em></span> was part of the original Unix
crew at Bell Labs.  Among other contributions, he wrote the
<i>ms</i> macro package, the
tbl(1)
and
refer(1)
tools for word processing, the
lex(1)
lexical-analyzer generator, and <i>UUCP</i>
(Unix-to-Unix copy program).</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Doug McIlroy</em></span> headed the research group at
Bell Labs where Unix was born and invented the Unix pipe.  He wrote
spell(1),
diff(1),
sort(1),
join(1),
tr(1),
and other classic Unix tools, and helped define the traditional style
of Unix documentation.  He has also done pioneering work in
storage-allocation algorithms, computer security, and
theorem-proving.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Marshall Kirk McKusick</em></span> implemented the
4.2BSD fast file system and was the Research Computer Scientist at the
Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) overseeing the
development and release of 4.3BSD and 4.4BSD.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Keith Packard</em></span> was a major contributor to
the original X11 code.  During a second phase of involvement beginning
in 1999, Keith rewrote the X rendering code, producing a more powerful
but dramatically smaller implementation suitable for handheld
computers and PDAs.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Eric S. Raymond</em></span> has been writing Unix
software since 1982. In 1991 he edited <i>The New Hacker's
Dictionary</i>, and has since been studying the Unix community
and the Internet hacker culture from a historical and anthropological
perspective.  In 1997 that study produced <i>The Cathedral and
the Bazaar</i>, that helped (re)define and energize the
open-source movement.  He presently maintains more than thirty
open-source software projects and about a dozen key FAQ
documents.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Henry Spencer</em></span> was a leader among the first
wave of programmers to embrace Unix when it escaped from Bell Labs in
the mid-1970s.  His contributions included the public-domain
getopt(3),
the first open-source string library, and an open-source
regular-expression engine which found use in 4.4BSD and as the
reference for the POSIX standard.  He is also a noted expert on the
arcana of C. He was a coauthor of C News, and has for many years been
a voice of reason on Usenet and one of its most respected regulars.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Ken Thompson</em></span> invented Unix.</p><a id="id3031471" class="indexterm"/><a id="id3031486" class="indexterm"/><a id="id3031502" class="indexterm"/><a id="id3031517" class="indexterm"/><a id="id3031532" class="indexterm"/><a id="id3031552" class="indexterm"/><a id="id3031570" class="indexterm"/><a id="id3031585" class="indexterm"/><a id="id3031601" class="indexterm"/></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="apb.html#id3020425">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="unix_koans.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Bibliography </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Appendix D. Rootless Root</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
