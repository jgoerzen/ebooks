small and simple.  We've been through lots of good reasons to
keep it small and simple earlier in this book.  Here's a new 
one: you want the central data structures and the time-critical loops
in your code never to fall out of cache.</p><p>Consider your target machine as a hierarchy of memory types
arranged by distance from the processor.  There are the processor's
own registers; its instruction pipeline; the level-one (L1) cache; the
level-two (L2) cache; possibly a level-three (L3) cache; main memory
(what Unix old hands still quaintly call &#8216;core&#8217;); and the disk
drives where swap space lives.  Technologies like SMP,
shared-memory clusters, and non-uniform memory access (NUMA) add 
more layers to the picture but only widen the overall spread.</p><p>Every kind of access to that stack is getting faster. Processor
cycles are almost free, outside of a few demanding applications like
modeling nuclear explosions or real-time video compression.  But
what's also happening is that the speed ratios between layers in the
storage hierarchy are all increasing as processor speeds go up.  Thus,
the relative cost of a cache miss is increasing.</p><p>So we have an interesting paradox.  As machine resources plummet, the
expected cost of large data structures falls &#8212; but because the cost
spread between adjacent cache levels is also going up, the
performance impact of being just large enough to break a cache
boundary is also rising.</p><p>&#8220;Small is beautiful&#8221; is therefore better advice
than ever, particularly with regard to central data structures that
must live in the fastest possible cache.  The advice applies to code
as well; the average instruction spends more time being loaded than
it does executing.</p><p>This turns some traditional advice on its head.  Compiler
optimizations like loop unrolling, which get rid of relatively
expensive machine instructions in return for an increase in total code
size, may no longer be worth doing.  Another example is precomputing
small tables &#8212; for example, a table of sin(x) by degree for
optimizing rotations in a 3D graphics engine will take 365 × 
4 bytes on a modern machine.  Before processors got enough faster than
memory to demand caching, this was an obvious speed optimization.
Nowadays it may be faster to recompute each time rather than pay for
the percentage of additional cache misses caused by the table.</p><p>But in the future, this might turn around again as caches grow
larger.  More generally, many optimizations are temporary and can
easily turn into pessimizations as cost ratios change.  The only way
to know is to measure and see.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch12s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="optimizationchapter.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch12s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Measure before Optimizing </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Throughput vs. Latency</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
