been the stability of the C language and the handful of service
interfaces that always travel with it (notably, the standard I/O
library and friends).  The fact that a language originated in 1973 has
required as little change as this one has in thirty years of heavy use
is truly remarkable, and without parallels anywhere else in computer
science or engineering.</p><p>In <a href="modularitychapter.html" title="Chapter 4. Modularity">Chapter 4</a>, we
argued that C has been successful because it acts as a layer of thin
glue over computer hardware approximating the &#8220;standard
architecture&#8221; of [<a href="apb.html#BlaauwBrooks" title="[BlaauwBrooks]">BlaauwBrooks</a>].  There is, of course, more to the story than
that. To understand the rest of the story, we'll need to take a brief
look at the history of C.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2998213"/>Early History of C</h3></div></div><p>C began life in 1971 as a systems-programming language for the
PDP-11<a id="id2998222" class="indexterm"/> port of
Unix, based on Ken Thompson's<a id="id2998234" class="indexterm"/> earlier B interpreter which had in turn been
modeled on BCPL, the Basic Common Programming Language designed at
Cambridge University in 1966-67.<sup>[<a id="id2998245" href="#ftn.id2998245">142</a>]</sup></p><p>Dennis Ritchie's<a id="id2998269" class="indexterm"/> original C compiler (often called the
&#8220;DMR&#8221; compiler after his initials) served the rapidly
growing community around Unix versions 5, 6, and 7.  Version 6 C
spawned Whitesmiths C, a reimplementation that became the first
commercial C compiler and the nucleus of IDRIS, the first Unix
workalike. But most modern C implementations are patterned on Steven
C. Johnson's &#8220;portable C compiler&#8221; (PCC) which debuted in
Version 7 and replaced the DMR compiler entirely in both System
V<a id="id2998294" class="indexterm"/> and the BSD
4.x<a id="id2998302" class="indexterm"/> releases.</p><p>In 1976, Version 6 C introduced the <tt>typedef</tt>, <tt>union</tt>, and <tt>unsigned
int</tt> declarations.  The approved syntax for variable
initializations and some compound operators also changed.</p><p>The original description of C was Brian Kernighan and Dennis
M. Ritchie's<a id="id2994041" class="indexterm"/>
original <i>The C Programming Language</i> aka
&#8220;the White Book&#8221; [<a href="apb.html#Kernighan-Ritchie" title="[Kernighan-Ritchie]">Kernighan-Ritchie</a>].  It
was published in 1978, the same year the Whitemiths C compiler
became available. </p><p>The White Book described enhanced Version 6 C, with one
significant exception involving the handling of public storage.
Ritchie's original intention had been to model C's rules on FORTRAN
COMMON declarations, on the theory that any machine that could handle
FORTRAN would be ready for C.  In the common-block model, a public
variable may be declared multiple times; identical declarations are
merged by the linker.  But two early C ports (to Honeywell and IBM 360
mainframes) happened to be to machines with very limited common
storage or a primitive linker or both.  Thus, the Version 6 C compiler
was moved to the stricter definition-reference model (requiring at
most one definition of any given public variable and the
<b>extern</b> keyword tagging references to it) described
in [<a href="apb.html#Kernighan-Ritchie" title="[Kernighan-Ritchie]">Kernighan-Ritchie</a>].</p><p>This decision was reversed in the C compiler that shipped with
Version 7 after it developed that a great deal of existing source
depended on the looser rules.  Pressure for backward-compatibility
would foil yet another attempt to switch (in 1983's System V
Release 1<a id="id2994104" class="indexterm"/>)
before the ANSI Draft Standard finally settled on definition-reference
rules in 1988.  Common-block public storage is still admitted as an
acceptable variation by the standard.</p><p>V7 C introduced <tt>enum</tt> and
treated <tt>struct</tt> and <tt>union</tt> values as first-class objects that
could be assigned, passed as arguments, and returned from functions
(rather than being passed around by address).</p><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>Another major change in V7 was that Unix data structure declarations
were now documented on header files, and included.  Previous Unixes
had actually printed the data structures (e.g., for directories) in
the manual, from which people would copy it into their code.  Needless
to say, this was a major portability problem.</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution">

declarations so that members with the same names in different structs
would not clash.  It also introduced <tt>void</tt> and
<tt>unsigned char</tt> declarations.  The scope of
<tt>extern</tt> declarations local to a function was
restricted to the function, and no longer included all code following
it. </p><p>The ANSI C Draft Proposed Standard added <tt>const</tt> (for read-only storage) and <tt>volatile</tt> (for locations such as memory-mapped
I/O registers that might be modified asynchronously from the thread of
program control). The <tt>unsigned</tt> type
modifier was generalized to apply to any type, and a symmetrical
<tt>signed</tt> was added.  Initialization
syntax for <tt>auto</tt> array and structure
initializers and <tt>union</tt> types was
added. Most importantly, function prototypes were added.</p><p>The most important changes in early C were the switch to
definition-reference and the introduction of function prototypes in
the Draft Proposed ANSI C Standard. The language has been essentially
stable since copies of the X3J11 committee's working papers on the
Draft Proposed Standard signaled the committee's intentions to
compiler implementers in 1985-1986.</p><p>A more detailed history of early C, written by its designer, can

great care taken to preserve the spirit of the original C language,
and an emphasis on ratifying experiments in existing compilers rather
than inventing new features. The C9X charter<sup>[<a id="id2994347" href="#ftn.id2994347">143</a>]</sup> document is an excellent expression
of this mission.</p><p>Work on the first official C standard began in 1983 under the

contents of the standard libraries dragged on for years. The formal
standard was not issued until the end of 1989, well after most
compilers had implemented the 1985 recommendations.  The standard was
originally known as ANSI X3.159, but was redesignated ISO/IEC
9899:1990 when the International Standards Organization (ISO) took
over sponsorship in 1990.  The language variant it describes is
generally known as C89 or C90.</p><p>The first book on C and Unix portability practice,
<i>Portable C and Unix Systems Programming</i> [<a href="apb.html#Lapin" title="[Lapin]">Lapin</a>], was published in 1987 (I wrote it under a corporate
pseudonym forced on me by my employers at the time).  The Second
Edition of [<a href="apb.html#Kernighan-Ritchie" title="[Kernighan-Ritchie]">Kernighan-Ritchie</a>] came out in 1988.</p><p>A very minor revision of C89, known as Amendment 1, AM1, or C93,
was floated in 1993.  It added more support for wide characters and
Unicode. This became ISO/IEC 9899-1:1994.</p><p>Revision of the C89 standard began in 1993.  In 1999, ISO/IEC
9899 (generally known as C99) was adopted by ISO.  It incorporated
Amendment 1, and added a great many minor features.  Perhaps the most
significant one for most programmers is the C++-like ability to
declare variables at any point in a block, rather than just at the
beginning.  Macros with a variable number of arguments were also
added.</p><p>The C9X working group has a
<a href="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/projects" target="_top">
Web page</a>, but no third standards effort is planned as
of mid-2003.  They are developing an addendum on C for 
embedded systems.</p><p>Standardization of C has been greatly aided by the fact that
working and largely compatible implementations were running on a wide
variety of systems before standards work was begun.  This made it
harder to argue about what features should be in the standard.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr width="100" align="left"/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.id2998245" href="#id2998245">142</a>] </sup>The &#8216;C&#8217; in
