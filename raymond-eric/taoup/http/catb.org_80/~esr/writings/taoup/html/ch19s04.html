Definition have well-established interpretive traditions. Developers
(and, to the extent they care, users) know what they imply, and have a
reasonable take on the risks and tradeoffs they involve. Therefore,
use one of the standard licenses carried on the OSI site if at all
possible.</p><p>If you must write your own license, be sure to have it certified
by OSI. This will avoid a lot of argument and overhead. Unless you've
been through it, you have no idea how nasty a licensing flamewar can
get; people become passionate because the licenses are regarded as
almost-sacred covenants touching the core values of the open-source
community.</p><p>Furthermore, the presence of an established interpretive
tradition may prove important if your license is ever tested in
court. At time of writing (mid-2003) there is no case law either
supporting or invalidating any open-source license. However, it is
a legal doctrine (at least in the United States, and probably in other
common-law countries such as England and the rest of the British
Commonwealth) that courts are supposed to interpret licenses and
contracts according to the expectations and practices of the
community in which they originated. There is thus good reason to
hope that open-source community practice will be determinative when
the court system finally has to cope.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch19s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="opensourcechapter.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch19s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Logic of Licenses: How to Pick One </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Varieties of Open-Source Licensing</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
