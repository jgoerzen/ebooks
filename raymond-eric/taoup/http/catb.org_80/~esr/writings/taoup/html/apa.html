   distributions issued by the Computer Science Research Group at the
   University of California at
   Berkeley<a id="id3021225" class="indexterm"/> between
   1976 and 1994, and of the open-source Unixes genetically descended
   from them.</p></dd><dt>CLI</dt><dd><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Command Line Interface.</em></span> Considered

   Perl modules and extensions.</p></dd><dt><a id="gnu_project"/>GNU</dt><dd><a id="id3021299" class="indexterm"/><p><span class="emphasis"><em>GNU's Not
   Unix!</em></span> The recursive acronym for the Free Software
   Foundation's project to produce an entire free-software clone of
   Unix.  This effort didn't completely succeed, but did produce many of
   the essential tools of modern Unix development including Emacs and
   the GNU Compiler Collection.</p></dd><dt>GUI</dt><dd><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Graphical User Interface.</em></span> The modern
   style of application interface using mice, windows, and icons
   invented at Xerox PARC during the 1970s, as opposed to the older

   A GUI workbench for developing code, featuring facilities like
   symbolic debugging, version control, and data-structure browsing.
   These are not commonly used under Unix, for reasons discussed in
   <a href="toolschapter.html" title="Chapter&#160;15.&#160;Tools">Chapter&#160;15</a>.</p></dd><dt><a id="ietf"/>IETF</dt><dd><a id="id3019971" class="indexterm"/><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Internet Engineering Task Force.</em></span> The
   entity responsible for defining Internet protocols such as
   TCP/IP. A loose, collegial organization mainly of technical
   people.</p></dd><dt>IPC</dt><dd><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Inter-Process Communication.</em></span> Any

   that tries to encapsulate data to be manipulated and the code that
   manipulates it in (theoretically) sealed containers called objects.
   By contrast, non-object-oriented programming is more casual about
   exposing the internals of the data structure and code.</p></dd><dt>OS</dt><dd><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Operating System.</em></span> The foundation software of a
   machine; that which schedules tasks, allocates storage, and presents a
   default interface to the user between applications.  The facilities an
   operating system provides and its general design philosophy exert an
   extremely strong influence on programming style and on the technical
   cultures that grow up around its host machines.</p></dd><dt><a id="pdf"/>PDF</dt><dd><a id="id3020124" class="indexterm"/><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Portable Document Format.</em></span> The
   PostScript language for control of printers and other imaging

   conveniently be used as a display format.</p></dd><dt><a id="pdp11"/>PDP-11</dt><dd><a id="id3020161" class="indexterm"/><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Programmable Data Processor 11.</em></span> Possibly
   the single most successful minicomputer design in history; first
   shipped in 1970, last shipped in 1990, and the immediate ancestor
   of the VAX.  The PDP-11 was the first major Unix platform.</p></dd><dt><a id="png_def"/>PNG</dt><dd><a id="id3020200" class="indexterm"/><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Portable Network Graphics.</em></span> The World
   Wide Web Consortium's standard and recommended format for bitmap

   standard.  The name arose at a time when the documents were
   regarded as proposals to be submitted to a then-nonexistent 
   but anticipated formal approval process of some sort.  The
   formal approval process never materialized.</p></dd><dt>RPC</dt><dd><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Remote Procedure Call.</em></span> Use of
   IPC methods that attempt to create the illusion that the 
   processes exchanging them are running in the same address 
   space, so they can cheaply (a) share complex structures, and (b)
   call each other like function libraries, ignoring latency and other
   performance considerations.  This illusion is notoriously
   difficult to sustain.</p></dd><dt><a id="tcpip"/>TCP/IP</dt><dd><a id="id3020293" class="indexterm"/><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
   Protocol.</em></span> The basic protocol of the Internet since the
   conversion from NCP (Network Control Protocol) in 1983. Provides 
   reliable transport of data streams.</p></dd><dt>UDP/IP</dt><dd><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Universal Datagram Protocol/Internet
   Protocol.</em></span> Provides unreliable but low-latency transport
   for small data packets.</p></dd><dt>UI</dt><dd><p><span class="emphasis"><em>User Interface.</em></span></p></dd><dt>VAX</dt><dd><p>Formally, <span class="emphasis"><em>Virtual Address Extension</em></span>:
   the name of a classic minicomputer design developed by Digital
   Equipment Corporation (later merged with Compaq, later merged with
   Hewlett-Packard) from the PDP-11<a id="id3020372" class="indexterm"/>. The
   first VAX shipped in 1977.  For ten years after 1980 VAXen were
   among the most important Unix platforms.  Microprocessor
   reimplementations are still shipping today.
