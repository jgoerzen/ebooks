terms: can this code be moved sideways to existing hardware and
software platforms other than the one it was built for?  But Unix
experience over decades tells us that durability down through time is
just as important, if not more so.  If we could predict the future of
software in detail it would probably be the present &#8212;
nevertheless, in programming for portability we should try to think
about making choices that will base the software on the features of
its environment that are likeliest to persist, and avoid technologies
that seem likely to face end-of-life in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Under Unix, two decades of attention to the issues of
specifying portable APIs has largely solved that problem.  Facilities
described in the Single Unix Specification are likely to be present
on all modern Unix platforms today and rather unlikely to go 
unsupported in the future.</p><p>But not all platform dependencies have to do with the system
or library APIs.  Your implementation language can matter; file-system
layout and configuration differences between the source and target
system can be a problem as well.  But Unix practice has evolved ways 
to cope.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3000303"/>Portability and Choice of Language</h3></div></div><p>The first issue in programming for portability is your choice of
implementation language.  All the major languages we surveyed in <a href="languageschapter.html" title="Chapter 14. Languages">Chapter 14</a> are highly portable
in the sense that compatible implementations are available across all
modern Unixes; for most, implementations under Windows and MacOS are
available as well.  Portability problems tend to arise not in the core
languages but in support libraries and degree of integration with the
local environment (especially IPC and concurrent-process management,
including the infrastructure for GUIs).</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="c_portability"/>C Portability</h4></div></div><a id="id3000340" class="indexterm"/><p>The core C language is extremely portable.  The standard Unix
implementation is the GNU C compiler, which is ubiquitous not only in
open-source Unixes but modern proprietary Unixes as well.  GNU C has
been ported to Windows and classic MacOS, but is not widely used in
either environment because it lacks portable bindings to the native
GUI.</p><p>The standard I/O library, mathematics routines, and
internationalization support are portable across all C
implementations.  File I/O, signals, and process control are portable
across Unixes provided one takes care to use only the modern APIs
described in the Single Unix Specification; older C code often has
thickets of preprocessor conditionals for portability, but those
handle legacy pre-POSIX interfaces from older proprietary Unixes that 
are obsolete or close to it in 2003.</p><p>C portability starts to be a more serious problem near IPC,
threads, and GUI interfaces.  We discussed IPC and threads portability
issues in <a href="multiprogramchapter.html" title="Chapter 7. Multiprogramming">Chapter 7</a>. The real practical problem is GUI
toolkits.  A number of open-source GUI toolkits are universally
portable across modern Unixes and to Windows and classic MacOS as well
&#8212; Tk, wxWindows, GTK, and Qt are four well-known ones with source
code and documentation readily discoverable by Web search.  But none
of them is shipped with all platforms, and (for reasons more legal
than technical) none of these offers the native-GUI look and feel on
all platforms.  We gave some guidelines for coping in <a href="toolschapter.html" title="Chapter 15. Tools">Chapter 15</a>.</p><p>Volumes have been written on the subject of how to write 
portable C code.  This book is not going to be one of them.   Instead,
we recommend a careful reading of <i>Recommended C Style and 
Coding Standards</i> [<a href="apb.html#Cannon" title="[Cannon]">Cannon</a>]
and the chapter on portability in
<i>The Practice of Programming</i> 
[<a href="apb.html#Kernighan-Pike99" title="[Kernighan-Pike99]">Kernighan-Pike99</a>].</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="cc_portability"/>C++ Portability</h4></div></div><a id="id3000442" class="indexterm"/><p>C++ has all the same operating-system-level portability issues as C,
and some of its own.
An additional one is that the open-source GNU compiler for C++ has
lagged substantially behind the proprietary implementations for most
of its existence; thus, there is not yet as of mid-2003 a
universally deployed equivalent of GNU C on which to base a de-facto
standard.  Furthermore, no C++ compiler yet implements the full C++99
ISO standard for the language, though GNU C++ comes closest.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="shell_portability"/>Shell Portability</h4></div></div><a id="id3000477" class="indexterm"/><p>Shell-script portability is, unfortunately, poor.  The problem
is not shell itself;
bash(1)
(the open-source Bourne Again shell) has become sufficiently
ubiquitous that pure shellscripts can run almost anywhere.  The
problem is that most shellscripts make heavy use of other commands and
filters that are much less portable, and by no means guaranteed to be
in the toolkit in any given target machine.</p><p>This problem can be overcome by dint of heroic effort, as in the
autoconf(1)
tools.  But it is sufficiently severe that most of the heavier sort of
programming that used to be done in shell has moved to
second-generation scripting languages<a id="id3000524" class="indexterm"/> like Perl, Python, and Tcl.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="perl_portability"/>Perl Portability</h4></div></div><a id="id3000544" class="indexterm"/><p>Perl has good portability. Stock Perl even offers a portable set
of bindings to the Tk toolkit that supports portable GUIs across
Unix, MacOS and Windows. One issue dogs it, however.  Perl scripts often
require add-on libraries from CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network) which are not guaranteed to be present with every Perl
implementation.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="python_portability"/>Python Portability</h4></div></div><a id="id3000576" class="indexterm"/><p>Python has excellent portability.  Like Perl, stock Python even
offers a portable set of bindings to the Tk toolkit that supports
portable GUIs across Unix, MacOS, and Windows.</p><p>Stock Python has a much richer standard library than does
Perl<a id="id3000598" class="indexterm"/> and no
equivalent of CPAN for programmers to rely on; instead, important
extension modules are routinely incorporated into the stock Python
distribution during minor releases. This trades a spatial problem for
a temporal one, making Python much less subject to the missing-module
effect at the cost of making Python minor version numbers somewhat
more important than Perl release levels are.  In practice, the
tradeoff seems to favor Python.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="tcl_portability"/>Tcl Portability</h4></div></div><a id="id3000626" class="indexterm"/><p>Tcl portability is good, overall, but varies sharply by project
complexity.  The Tk toolkit for cross-platform GUI programming is
native to Tcl.  As with Python, evolution of the core language has
been relatively smooth, with few version-skew problems.
Unfortunately, Tcl relies even more heavily than Perl on extension
facilities that are not guaranteed to ship with every implementation
&#8212; and there is no equivalent of CPAN to centrally distribute
them.</p><p>For smaller projects not reliant on extensions, therefore, Tcl
portability is excellent.  But larger projects tend to depend heavily
on both extensions and (as with shell programming) calling external
commands that may or may not be present on the target machine; their
portability tends to be poor.</p><p>Tcl may have suffered, ironically, from
the ease of adding extensions to it.  By the time a particular extension
started to look interesting as part of the standard distribution, there
typically were several different versions of it in existence.  At the
1995 Tcl/Tk Workshop, John Ousterhout explained why there was no OO
support in the standard Tcl distribution:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Think of five mullahs sitting around in a circle, all saying
&#8220;Kill him, he's a heathen&#8221;.  If I put a specific OO
scheme into the core, then one of them will say &#8220;Bless you, my
son, you may kiss my ring&#8221;, and the other four will say
&#8220;Kill him, he's a heathen&#8221;.</p></blockquote></div><p>The lot of a language designer is not necessarily a happy one.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="java_portability"/>Java Portability</h4></div></div><a id="id3000711" class="indexterm"/><p>Java portability is excellent &#8212; it was, after all,
designed with &#8220;write once, run everywhere&#8221; as a primary
goal.  Portability fails, however, to be perfect.  The difficulties are
mostly version-skew problems between JDK 1.1 and the older AWT GUI
toolkit (on the one hand) and JDK 1.2 with the newer Swing GUI toolkit.
There are several important reasons for these:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Sun's AWT design was so deficient that it had to be replaced 
with Swing.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft's<a id="id3000755" class="indexterm"/>
refusal to support Java development on Windows and attempt to replace
it with C#.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft's decision to hold Internet Explorer's applet support 
at the JDK 1.1 level.</p></li><li><p>Sun<a id="id3000782" class="indexterm"/>
licensing terms that make open-source implementations of JDK 1.2
impossible, retarding its deployment (especially in the Linux
world).</p></li></ul></div><p>For programs that involve GUIs, Java developers seeking
portability will, for the foreseeable future, face a choice: Stay in
JDK 1.1/AWT with a poorly designed toolkit for maximum portability
(including to Microsoft Windows<a id="id3000804" class="indexterm"/>), or get the better toolkit and
capabilities of JDK 1.2 at the cost of sacrificing some
portability.</p><p>Finally, as we noted previously, the Java thread support has
portability problems.  The Java API, unlike less ambitious
operating-system bindings for other languages, bravely tried to bridge
the gaps between the diverging process models offered by different
operating systems.  It does not quite manage the trick.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a id="emacs_lisp_portability"/>Emacs Lisp Portability</h4></div></div><a id="id3000836" class="indexterm"/><p>Emacs Lisp portability is excellent. Emacs installations tend to
be upgraded frequently, so seriously out-of-date environments are
rare.  The same extension Lisp<a id="id3000854" class="indexterm"/> is supported everywhere and effectively
all extensions are shipped with Emacs itself.</p><p>Then, too, the primitive set of Emacs is quite stable.  It
achieved completeness for the things an editor has to do (manipulating
buffers, bashing text) years ago.  Only the introduction of X has
disturbed this picture at all, and very few Emacs modes need to be
aware of X.  Portability problems are usually manifestations of quirks
in the C-level bindings of operating-system facilities; control of
subordinate processes in modes like mail agents is about the only
issue where such problems manifest with any frequency.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3000882"/>Avoiding System Dependencies</h3></div></div><p>Once your language and support libraries are chosen, the next
portability issue is usually the location of key system files and
directories: mail spools, logfile directories and the like.
The archetype of this sort of problem is whether the mail spool
directory is <tt>/var/spool/mail</tt> or
<tt>/var/mail</tt>.</p><p>Often, you can avoid this sort of dependency by stepping back
and reframing the problem.  Why are you opening a file in the mail
spool directory, anyway?  If you're writing to it, wouldn't it be
better to simply invoke the local mail transport agent to do it for
you so the file-locking gets done right?  If you're reading from it, 
might it be better to query it through a POP3 or IMAP server?</p><p>The same sort of question applies elsewhere.  If you find
yourself opening logfiles manually, shouldn't you be using
syslog(3)
instead?  Function-call interfaces through the C library are better
standardized than system file locations.  Use that fact!</p><p>If you must have system file locations in your code, your best
alternative depends on whether you will be distributing in source code
or binary form.  If you are distributing in source, the
<i>autoconf</i> tools we discuss in the next
section will help you.  If you're distributing in binary, then it's
good practice to have your program poke around at runtime and see if
it can automatically adapt itself to local conditions &#8212; say, by
actually checking for the existence of <tt>/var/mail</tt> and <tt>/var/spool/mail</tt>.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3000984"/>Tools for Portability</h3></div></div><p>You can often use the open-source GNU
autoconf(1)
we surveyed in <a href="toolschapter.html" title="Chapter 15. Tools">Chapter 15</a> to
handle portability issues, do system-configuration probes, and tailor
your makefiles.  People building from sources today expect to be able
to type <b>configure; make; make install</b> and get a
clean build.  There is a good <a href="http://seul.org/docs/autotut/" target="_top">tutorial on these
tools</a>. Even if you're distributing in binary, the
autoconf(1)
tools can help automate away the problem of conditionalizing your code
for different platforms.</p><p>Other tools that address this problem; two of the better known
are the
Imake(1)
tool associated with the X windowing system and the <i>Configure</i> tool built by Larry Wall (later
the inventor of Perl<a id="id3001065" class="indexterm"/>) and adapted for many different
projects.  All are at least as complicated as the autoconf suite, and
no longer as often used.  They don't cover as wide a range of target
systems.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch17s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="portabilitychapter.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch17s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Specifications as DNA, Code as RNA </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Internationalization</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
